1658969673,Perfumes,DS and Durga - I Don‚Äôt Know What Review,"I recently got my hands on a sample of DS and Durga‚Äôs I Don‚Äôt Know What fragrance enhancer and it is blowing my mind. The main ‚Äúnotes‚Äù are iso e super, ambrox super, and a top note of bergamot. I would swim in this stuff if I could afford it (50 mL is $190) but luckily I only need one spray per day - it has insane longevity and moderate sillage. 

Their website describes it as ‚ÄúIt is like a building with only structure‚Äîno interior. You can fill in the interior with an oil, a scent you like, even an old scent that has lost its way. IDKW is built to layer and enhance everything else it touches.‚Äù

And the site goes on to describe iso e super as ‚ÄúWarm and ambery like patchouli with all trace of its aromatic profile sucked out‚Äù, which is exactly what I am getting. It is so fun and sexy and mysterious - very unisex but not particularly femme or masc. I love the general experience of patchouli but have always found it too cloying to wear due to the intensely identifiable aroma and hippie association (lol). I would wear I Don‚Äôt Know What on its own as an everyday scent if I had the full bottle.

I layered it on top of DS and Durga‚Äôs Rose Atlantic and it made the perfume explode in such a beautiful way. Typically Rose Atlantic has very weak longevity on me, but I can smell it many hours later with I Don‚Äôt Know What on top. Rose Atlantic is much more subtle, a waxy sea salt rose scent. A gorgeous modern rose scent if you‚Äôre looking for one.

What perfumes have you come across that are specifically for layering? Have you enjoyed them?"
1658974798,Perfumes,The most unexpected compliment.,"Today I got into the elevator during my lunch break &amp; I saw a 10/10 getting in the lift with me. I knew straight off that she is way out of my league so i decided not to make a move.

I was walking away from the lift as we got down, Suddenly heard the sound of a pair of heels trotting towards me really fast. She was like 

‚Äú Excuse me Hi I‚Äôm ___ , we were in the lift together and your perfume literally made me go crazy. I feel like it just tapped into my animal instinct, what is it your wearing? ‚Äú

I did NOT expect that! Because the way she spoke to me, She was acting like she was hungry for me. I did tell her the name of the perfume and we exchanged numbers. 

After all this happened I was like ‚ÄúWoah!‚Äù What did I just hear. She literally made my day,

I know this scent not for everyone plus I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a modern day fragrance. But I feel like the ‚ÄúChanel Egoiste‚Äù is a mysterious masterpiece.

1659004339,Perfumes,#SOTD Arsenico by V Canto,
1659004444,Perfumes,#SOTD Arsenico by V Canto,"Arsenico is a beautiful unisex fragrance which includes some interesting notes that are working amazingly good together and surprised me in a good way.

Top notes- calabrian bergamot, red currant, apple and pineapple.  
Middle notes- red patchouli, birch, jasmine, tonka bean, benzoin, cedar and artemisia  
Base notes- amber grey, moss and musk

This beautiful creation opens up with a graceful citrusy bouquet which is guided by calabrian bergamot and slowly becomes sweet thanks to the red fruits. All of this beauty flows to a woody vibe with some red patchouli, cedar and tonka bean which are all emraced by the jasmine and benzoin. This fragrance, with its incredible persistent trail is so long lasting because its true strength is found in grey amber, blended with ancient musk and precious mosses.  
Lovely!!! 

I tried it a few years ago and didn't feel it was right for me. But today, after I grew up a bit, I feel like I now realize what I have been missing. It's such a gorgeous fragrance, so mature and so elegant. Today I know that sometimes we need to give the fragrances the time they need :)"

1659048945,Perfumes,Looking for something inexpensive that will make me smell like straight up coconut,"I love the smell of coconuts. I absolutely despise the taste and texture of them, but for some reason it‚Äôs probably my favorite smell on the planet. I love smelling like coconut, but purely coconut smelling fragrances are oddly hard to come by. I‚Äôve found plenty of things with notes of coconut, but it‚Äôs always either extremely faint or overpowered by something else, like vanilla or some kind of fruit or god forbid that awful artificial ‚Äúbeach wind‚Äù smell that lights my nostrils on fire. I‚Äôm autistic and have pretty severe sensory processing disorder so I tend to be ridiculously sensitive to smells, so anything unpleasant or sharp mixed into the coconut smell kinda ruins it for me, and I also have an aversion to feeling greasy or oily so straight up coconut oil doesn‚Äôt work either. Is there any generally inexpensive product (like &lt;$30, it doesn‚Äôt need to be anything fancy), be it perfume, cologne, body wash, body spray, conditioner, etc. that just smells like coconut and smells strongly of it too? So far the best thing I‚Äôve found is the coco loco from lush usa, but I go through them so fast and the scent doesn‚Äôt last super long."

I am looking for a fragrance for the coming winter that comes off a bit as mysterious , that wont destroy my wallet. Preferably I would like it to be also appropriate for ""everyday"" use but it's not THAT important.

I am between MM Replica Jazz Club EDT for 100$ or Initio Side Effect EDP for 240$ , which I've heard they come off as ""sexy"" and ""mysterious"". I'm not very sure if the 140$ difference is worth it though. What's your opinion?

I would say out of all of the Delinas, I much prefer La Rosee, with the OG Delina coming in at a close second but not quite FBW to me. I actually found Delina Exclusiv to be repulsive, I guess it may be the amber note that's more prominent in the dry down since  I generally do not like anything with an amber note.  I like Meloria a lot but I've heard that there's a cheaper 'dupe' so, I'm on the fence about getting a full bottle of it. 

Unsure why Meloria retails for slightly more on PdM's website for the same size bottle, it actually has slightly worse longevity on my skin compared to La Rosee.

1659481988,Perfumes,Looking for a perfume that smells like Nemat‚Äôs Amber.,"I‚Äôve fallen in love with the scent of Nemat‚Äôs Amber oil.

It smells wonderful on my skin, but I feel that no one can smell it unless they‚Äôre sniffing my arm or neck (and well, that‚Äôs a little too close for most people). Ha! 

I‚Äôve been searching for a signature perfume that smells the same but gives a more moderate sillage. There are tons of Amber options out there, but a lot I‚Äôve tried smell too powdery. Powdery florals smell too mature to me, like an elderly woman‚Äôs fragrance so I avoid those.

I'm new to the world of perfumery and looking for a bit of advice.

I'm using two essential oils and one fragrance oil and am close to finding the perfect balance of the three for the smell I want.

I'm using perfumer's alcohol from Vetiver. I follow the 80/20 ratio and filling 10ml bottles with 8ml of alcohol and 2ml of oils.

40% top note, 50% middle note, 10% base note.

Here's the issue I'm experiencing and don't think it's normal.

When I attempt so spray the bottle, I have to put a lot of pressure on the top when pushing down. I feel like it shouldn't take so much, and I did something wrong. My alcohol supplier states on the site that adding water isn't necessary with the product I'm using.

I don't have any issues with the bottles before adding the perfume. What are you guys' thoughts?

Edit: Please if my alcohol to oil ratios are off let me know. Using 12 drops for top note, 20 drops for mid and 8 drops for base. That's the 2ml with 8ml alcohol for my 10ml bottles."

I still have the empty bottle that smells like it. It was sold as a nature identical sandalwood essential oil, however all the newer sandalwood essential oils from the same brand doesn't smell the same (and isn't branded as nature identical anymore, although I suspect it is still synthetic) and I really wish I could find out which compounds were used to make it.

The newer sandalwood fragrance oil smells very creamy, soft, mildly woody and almost creamsoda-y, and matches most of the other sandalwood scents I've encountered. In contrast, the older one smells resinous, dark, spicy and extremely woody (the oil is also much more viscous). Any idea which fragrance chemicals they could have used to create this original one?

I finished my BA last year and I've always been into skincare, beauty &amp; fragrance products but my love for fragrance really exploded in the last two years. I will spend hours watching youtube videos from perfumers, I will do endless research on a perfume I think I will like, which includes it's history, notes, the perfumer behind it, the year it was released, associated drama &amp; news and so on. 

I will find notes I like and deeply research those as well, and I've just had a transformative sensory experience with fragrance, I love meeting people who want to talk fragrance with me and I will always ask someone what they're wearing. When friends come over I encourage them to explore my perfumes and play, and I've helped a few friends make informed fragrance purchases.

1656164284,Perfumes,Abbott NYC- Please Read,"I fell in love with Cape and have been slowly trying out other scents. I have ordered from Sephora bc of points and their return policy. However Sephora does not have one scent I wanted to try so I ordered a new scent directly from the Abbott website and a small size of the scent Sephora does not carry. All arrived and the scent Voyageurs which I ordered in the small size had a very odd scent, it dries down to smell like fuel, an almost gasoline scent. 

I wrote Abbott per their refund policy stating such and I'd like to return it for a refund. The owner (?) Michael Pass emailed me back and said they could only refund me 50%. Website says full refund for defective product so I push back. He emails me back in an unhinged manor and makes claims I'm a conspiracy theorist and snarkily adds I've insulted their perfumes. What in the world?

In my email I highly complimented their perfumes and raved about the other scents I have and said I loved the other scent I received but Voyageurs dried down in a very unpleasant fuel-smelling way. 

They did refund me, but Michael Pass and his insane customer service has put me off Abbott forever. There was more malarkey to the entire story but I don't have proof of it so I won't go in to it.

Lastly, just a heads up. The company is branded as Abbott NYC but they're based out of Texas now. A lot of people learned why bussinesses move to TX after Elon Musk moved Tesla as he wasn't able to legally exploit his workforce in California."

For reference. We're in the US.  I remember her having it in the late 90s and/or early 2000s. She definitely no longer had it past 2008 or so. 

I remember sniffing it all the time and stealing dabs of it from her. It may have been discontinued. It could've also been a wedding present and if that's the case, it may be from the mid to late 80s.  My mom no longer remembers it so the wedding idea is just that.

1656955034,Perfumes,My budget scent finds,"I was just mentioning on here about a budget perfume that I am in love with. I have to add a couple to it:

1. Fancy (Jessica Simpson). It smells more ""grown-up"" than I expected &amp; it wears differently depending on the weather. It does well on me in the hot/humid summer weather. Fragrance is s said to be composed of sweet/fruity/caramel/vanilla/powdery/almond/white floral/fresh/nutty/amber. I get Caramel/Vanilla/Powder/Floral. 
2. Fantasy Intimate (Britney Spears). I don't know how these young gals are doing it but they are doing it well! This one is weirdly good one day and just nice the next. When it's good, it is not as flattering on me as Fancy but it's ""grown-up"" and  I get more of the musky and ozonic from the supposed accords of vanilla/sweet/musky/powdery/ozonic/citrus/fresh/fruity/white floral/amber
3. Egyptian Goddess (Auric Blends). It's an oil and it works better for me with fresh-from-the-shower skin or at bedtime. It's hard to describe but it's SO nice. It has all the ""main accords"" of powdery/musky/floral and is super soft, depending on how and where you apply it. If I apply just a bit to my wrists and throat, it's quiet and soft. If I want stronger projection, I also apply it to my bosom and right at the outside of my armpits. I only get the vanilla and musk with just enough floral to make the musk more feminine. This oil is a better one on me than the Kuumba Made Amber Paste that I like so much.

Now, realize that these will probably smell nicer and last longer on younger skin. I am 61 and no longer have the body great chemistry for fragrances. They tend to fade faster and not project as well as when I was under 50. (My mama did NOT tell me this about aging!)

The Fanny and Fantasy scents cost me under $20 each. Goddess was around $12.  I think that I sometimes get caught up in thinking price = better. I spent $30 on a small roller of The Only One and... it's a dud on me. It works really well, thank goodness if I layer it with the Egyptian Goddess or even Kuumba Made's Amber Paste. 

I also have turned my nose up at some celebrity scents but no longer. I have already asked for (and am waiting to receive) a bottle of Mariah Carey's Dreams, which sounds like it has my favorite notes in it.

 I also like the  Vanilla Bourbon from Mix:Bar but the perfume is no stronger or longer-lasting than the cheaper body mist. And their Cloud Musk is *such* a dupe for Glossier's You that I am stunned. Of course, it's not as long-lasting but, for the price, I'd rather keep re-applying Cloud Musk as often as needed. In my opinion, the perfume of Cloud Musk is better than the mist but I get a nicer boost from using both. I do the mist on my hair and clothes while I use the perfume on my skin."

1657210641,Perfumes,"Help Identify this Scent, Please!","Hello! I'm kinda new to this sub but and figured that this was the best place to turn to.

A little context: Not sure if I'm allergic to it, but ever since I was little I noticed that there was this distinct smell that was only worn by women 50+ older (like fellow church-goers or relatives. Never got to ask-didn't think to at the time). Didn't effect me so much then, but now if I smell it on strangers I get throbbing headaches. I know y'all can't diagnose anything thru that, and I wouldn't ask you to, but I'm insanely curious as to what scent these women are wearing. At the very least, I'll have a better idea of what's going on/have a name for that darned smell. 

Last time I caught a whiff, it smelled like some herbs and spices, and maybe a hint of weed? It really just screamed ""incense"" to me, like some old-timey scent. If it's an actual perfume, it has to be something from the US or a cheap import that is from the 60s(70s?). Anything I researched myself didn't look to be it. Also, I bring up age because a relative once told me it could be a product you use at an elderly age to mask sweat or other? Sounds weird, I know, but if it rings a bell, then I'd love to hear your thoughts. 

If it's not, the best guess I have is some type of herbal oil or natural scent? When I tried to research on individual herbs/aromas for aromatherapy, and frankincense sounded like the closest to it by description. But, I'm a dumb-dumb when it comes to things like that, and don't have the means to test that theory. 

I hope this helps. I'll try to answer as best I can if y'all have anymore questions. And thank you so much in advance for taking the time to help/read!"

I think I like Cloud because it's sweet and a gourmand but it's not a vanilla or caramel which usually smells overly syrupy in my experience. 

I also like YSL La Nuit L'Homme 

I can't find a perfume I like and it's starting to feel annoying. Please help!

Notes I smell in cloud:

* Cream
* Musk? (It smells very warm and soft)
* Lavender/pear (It's very subtle. I usually don't like lavender because it smells like soap but it works here)
* Praline (very subtle. I think it would smell like grandma butterscotch candies if it were strong)

1657522518,Perfumes,Guanahani Ladies from the Perfume factory on Grand Bahama Island...,"Hey there! I used to live in Marathon, FL, in the middle Keys. As such, my backyard then was pretty much the Caribbean, and my front yard was basically the Bahamas. I wound up falling in love with a perfume called 'Guanahani' that I found in Freeport, GBI. 

Well, now being in Chicago I don't get to the Bahamas as often - the last time I did I bought several bottle sof Guanahani, but now I've run out - and they claim they're no longer able to ship to the US due to American Customs. This is their link (NOT Spam), in case you want to check it out: [https://www.perfumefactory.com/fragrance/guanahani-ladies/](https://www.perfumefactory.com/fragrance/guanahani-ladies/)

Their website describes Guanahani as: ""A sweet fresh floral ‚Äì jasmine, gardenia, tuberose, mandarin, ylang ylang, patchouli and nutmeg"". I have no idea if the way these ingredients are listed reflects the amount of each in the fragrance, or if it's just random. IMHO Guanahani is a very, very unique scent - I have not smelled anything else like it... And that's the problem.

I would love to have a dupe of it - something similar. Can you guys help me? Thanks in advance!"

I'm currently looking for a fun fragrance that I can use for work, preferably something that can last a while with decent projection. Since it's just for work, I'm fine with cheaper perfumes.

I've been looking through fragrances, and I've been wondering if some of the Britney ones might be right for me. In the past, I've worn perfumes that smell kind of like tropical fruits - Onika by Nicki Minaj, for example - as well as fragrances that have strong vanilla and chocolate smells. If I smell like cake or baking, then I'm happy lol.

I haven't smelled the Britney fragrances before, and I'm struggling to know the difference. I've read the different notes, but I'm struggling to gauge if any might be inappropriate for day to day wear.

The only other fragrance I've started looking into are the Ariana Grande ones.

# 1: How Can I Pick Perfect Perfume For Myself?

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Know Your Scents**

The first few steps to choose your signature scent is to understand what are the notes inside the perfumes. Men's cologne have different categories that describe the ingredients and therefore the scents they create. 

Once you understand the categories you will understand what notes are for you and what you'd rather avoid. Do you like to smell flowery? Aquatic? Woody?

Be sure to consider your personality and style as well as the time of year and the occasion. They matter more than you think.

It sounds a lot of stuff to keep in mind to just smell nice but it‚Äôs worth every second of effort.

&amp;#x200B;

 **2. The Main Scents**

#### Aromatic

Aromatic scents are rich in benzene and notes found in organic matter. Aromatic fragrances commonly have rustic scents with a certain freshness, often coming from herbal notes, and are commonly indicated for men. The most common are rosemary, thyme, mint, tarragon, marjoram, fennel, basil, sage, ansine cumin, and grassy spicy plants.

#### Citrus

Citrus scents are created after hesperidin fruits. Think about Verbena, lemongrass, pomelo, yuzu as well as typical citrus fruits like lemon, orange, grapefruit, and mandarin. One of the most common is Bergamot (The Earl Gray smell). Citrus properties let these oils peak as top notes and sparkle on just about any **blend**.

#### Floral 

The largest group of scents is self-explanatory. These scents add a romantic touch and remove the heaviness of more tenacious ingredients. Some flowers are used in their natural state like rose, jasmine, tuberose, lavender, osmanthus, immortelle, ylang ylang, and marigold while others need to be recreated in labs like freesia, peony, lily of the valley, heliotrope, violet, jonquil, narcissus, hyacinth.

#### Leather

Historically speaking leather is one of the earliest notes used in perfumery. In the past, oils, musk, and ambergris were used to mask the odor of the animal skins. Nowadays these notes are both natural (birch, styrax, cassie, castoreum, myrtle) or recreated in labs (quinolines, safraleine, aldehyde and synthesized suede nuances).

#### Woody

Woody fragrances are dominated by wood scents. They add a sensual touch to the perfumes and empower other scents. This varied and versatile category includes oakmoss, amber, rosewood, guaiac, oud, vetiver, patchouli.

Smokey

Traditionally created with notes of incense, birch tar, tobacco, and various woods, including cedar and cypress, a smoky perfume is your ideal winter-warming fragrance.

#### Aquatic

Aquatic notes in a perfume is not a specific note but more of a fragrance composition that conveys freshness and purity. An aquatic note captures a sensation of the sea, fresh mountain air and freshly washed sheets and can be found in many modern and ""clean"" scents.

&amp;#x200B;

### Why Do The 4 Seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) Matter In Perfumes?

Much like putting on a sweater during the winter and a sundress in summer, you can think of perfumes as a seasonal part of your routine. You should choose the perfect amount of scent according to the weather outside. Warm weather brings out the best in fragrances. When the weather heats up we can smell so many scents in the air: flowers blooming, fruits ripening, we are bombarded by so many scents! 

Keep this in mind and adjust the amount of perfume you're going to use. Don't be afraid to ""wear"" a fragrance but be aware of its impact because when the temperature heats up the scents will be intensified and it's a good idea to choose a lighter scent. Citrus and floral **accords** are perfect for this time of the year because they project a light, refreshing scent and **blend** well with other scents that occur naturally in the environment.

On the opposite side we have cold weather that is great for perfumes with amber **accord**. When it's cold outside, rich and spicy scents give you a feeling of warmth. Lower temperatures can really lessen the impact of a scent!

Spring and fall are transitional seasons and the weather may change rapidly. Be ready to bring out floral notes during spring and choose warmer scents when summer turns into fall. 

Whether you stick with one signature or many based on your mood or the seasons, always learn how fragrances interact with your body chemistry and the temperature.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2: Why Should I Wear Fragrance/s?

### No One Likes To Smell Bad! 

It is instinctive for people to shun those who smell bad by either talking less with them or physically avoiding them. Think of how many times you have shunned someone just because of their smell?

Perhaps you are looking to expand your social circle or get a date (or two), wearing a fragrance that is suitable for the weather will allow you to smell good and attract more social interactions. Wearing Fragrances in addition to your clothes so as to both look and smell good to other people will surely enhance the social interaction and more compliments are always a good confidence booster! Not to mention, it can be a good ice-breaking conversation starter!

### ‚ÄúPerfume is the art that makes the memory speak.‚Äù - Francis Kurkdjian 

It's not uncommon for a scent to invoke a specific memory, like a magical deja vu moment.. I‚Äôm sure some scents do the same for you!

When you wear a specific fragrance to a special event or if you wear a specific fragrance while creating a memory, you will be in control to an extent. Why not create memories that you can remember when you smell a scent? 

Here is a little story about the funny memory linked to my ‚ÄúSignature Scent‚Äù. While I was doing [‚ÄúPortugal Tour‚Äù](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cc-_I7FrMm_/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=) I was sleeping in a hostel (which is something I love to do as you meet different people) and I planned to go out. Always before going out I go to a hotspot in the hostel where everyone is gathering. I had so many fragrances in my suitcase because I was delivering the customers that I forgot to bring my fragrances (ironic).

 One of the customers during my flight told he won‚Äôt make it and I should return the scent. 

Since I forgot mine, I decided to use it for myself. Oh boy I was lucky! It was ‚ÄòHint of Vanilla‚Äù. I applied only 1 spray since my skin projects crazy with it (will talk more about it later) and the Brazilian girl in the lobby was immediately hooked up.

 She was sitting the whole night before going out next to me and giving me compliments about the fragrance and how it reminds her of her home.

Let‚Äôs just say, that night was crazy!! Moving on.

**Life is short!! Be in control!!**

&amp;#x200B;

# 3: How Should I Wear Fragrance/s?

### Technique 1, Skin Type 2, Flavored Oils 3!

1. **Always Look To Perfect Your Spraying Technique**

**Find out which part of your body is most reactive to the perfume!** 

Try 3-4 sprays of your desired perfume on each individual pulse point and get a friend to smell you from your desired distance (up to 2 feet away) in order to determine which of your pulse points will project the scent better. **Some pulse points you can try: ‚Ä¶.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ge05qo2fosb91.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b5a600d909c36680c38e987d9888b84b080a3bd

  

**Layer the perfume!**

In order to get the perfumes to last longer, you can layer it. Just spray multiple layers of the perfume on top of your desired pulse point to optimize the **projection**.

**Spray and Layer on multiple pulse points!**

For maximum **projection**, spray 3-4 layers on **multiple** pulse points and you will smell like a champ all day everyday!

**Advanced: Mix up the Layers!**

You can **blend** your own type of fragrance just by layering 2 different types of fragrances on top of each other. For example, if you find that ***Leathery Path*** is too strong for your liking and feel that it needs to be a little sweeter, you can add a few layering sprays of ***American Dream*** on top of it! 

The possibilities are endless! [Share your mix in the Telegram chatroom and let's chat!](https://t.me/+M52nGQh_S4s3Yzhk)

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Remember, Not Every Type Of Perfume Will Stick To Your Skin!**

Everyone has a different skin chemistry, something that might work for someone might not work for you! Keep that in mind and don‚Äôt be too quick to blame the product if it doesn‚Äôt stick!

&amp;#x200B;

**3.Not All Flavored Oils Are Created Equal!**

Every perfume is a mixture of an alcohol base and a **blend** of flavor oils! 

Not all oils are the same, some flavor oils oxidize faster than the others, after oxidizing, they lose their aromatic properties. This is why perfumes smell different in the start and smell different when they enter into the **dry-down** stage. It is important to know that some oils (like citrus) will always oxidize faster than others (like woody and smokey). Always try the perfume on your skin and try to find out which one lasts!

# 4. Are Chez Pierre Perfumes Safe To Use On Skin?!

We at Chez Pierre only source quality ingredients from European and Arabic origins. 

Our perfumes have all the required EU certificates certifying and complying to all Health and Safety standards. 

In addition to that, our source ingredients comply with IFRA standards. The IFRA Standards are rigorously developed by designer fragrance houses and their various downline stakeholders so as to ensure that the consumers can enjoy certified fragrances with confidence without worries.

After all, we are a company registered in Europe (Serbia) and we ship from Serbia so we must comply with all EU regulations.

Because of the rigorous standards that we comply with, Chez Pierre fragrances are absolutely safe for your skin. We even encourage people to spray fragrances on neck and pulse spots and to avoid clothes.

Spraying on the clothes can actually leave stains and to be honest, no one wants that.

As written above we source certified quality ingredients from France and we make the final product in our highly managed production area. Don‚Äôt worry! it‚Äôs not coming from someone‚Äôs basement! Picture below =)

# 5: What Are Ratios and How Do I Pick Them?

A fragrance is usually a mix of a concentrate (containing fragrant oils) and an alcoholic base. Some fragrances can also contain a bit of water and additives like liquid UV filters, stabilizers or colorants. Therefore, fragrances with a higher fragrance concentration contain more **perfume oils** and less alcohol, and vice-versa.

Usually, a higher **perfume oil** concentration means an increased performance of the fragrance (particularly longer-lasting scent) ‚Äì but the impact of oil concentration is much more complex and varies depending on each formula. 

We use a mix of **Eau de Toilette** and pure **perfume oil** to create our ‚Äúratios‚Äù.

This means nothing to you? Yes I know so let‚Äôs keep it simple.

The main difference is the amount of **perfume oil** in the perfumes. 

Here is an example of what most of the industry uses and what you might have seen in stores:

**Eau de Cologne** (EDC) 3% - 10% oils

**Eau de Toilette** (EDT) 5% - 15% oils

**Eau de Parfum** (EDP) 15% - 20% oils

**Parfum** / **Extrait** 20% - 35% oils

**Eau de Parfum** (1:4)  is the most common ratio you will find in stores, it's not too oily and it stays on the skin for 4-8 hours depending on the fragrance, weather, and your skin. This is really important as every skin is different and absorbs fragrance differently. Fragrance cannot be the same on each skin as everybody is different. 2-3 sprays are enough to last thru the day.  
**Extrait de Parfum** (1:2) is a stronger version of the fragrance which contains almost double the amount of pure oil. **Projection** lasts from 4 to 12 hours but again as written above, many factors depend on it. We advise taking this ratio if your skin doesn‚Äôt hold the fragrance great. 1-2 sprays will be enough.

We think personally that EDC and EDT are too weak and therefore we don‚Äôt want to sell it.

We offer fragrances in EDP ratio (1:4) and **Extrait** ratio (1:2)  
The main difference is that we use 20% pure **perfume oil** for **Eau de Parfum** (1:4) and 35% for the **Extrait de Parfum** (1:2).

# 6: The 100$ Fragrance I Get In-Store Only Costs 2$ To Produce?

The cost to produce a ROLEX watch is actually only $500‚Ä¶ Why are you paying $10,000 for it?! Marketing, Manipulation, and Mania!

### Marketing, Manipulation, and Mania!

Market the product through all social media channels, influencers, physical billboards, and shopping malls! Make sure everyone‚Äôs eyeballs are on it. Put the products on thought leaders like celebrities, influencers, sports stars.

Manipulate by capping or reducing its supply!

Create the Mania and ride the wave!

How much does that fancy $100-a-bottle department store perfume you wear *really* cost to make? You will be surprised that the liquid in it is the cheapest part of the fragrance while everything else drives the price up

If perfumes were priced like sausages, they would cost about the same: roughly $2.50. 

Your butcher will tell you that sausages, just like most consumer goods are priced using the 

cost-plus approach. In other words, you add up the cost of making the product and mark it up to cover your overhead and your profit.

Why am I telling you this? Well in the fragrance world liquid costs only 2$ if you produce it in tones like big brands. Yes, you read it right, only 2$ for 50ml liquid.

Here is a rough table of how much it costs to make a ‚Äú100$ fragrance‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2pib6dyjosb91.png?width=1052&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed1015fe525b16c1dedb46e12fe2d68354938965

We don‚Äôt have the purchasing power of a large designer brand. Hence, we can‚Äôt get volume discounts when buying ingredients. Volume drives the cost per unit down because it forms a bigger base over which the manufacturer can spread their fixed cost.

On the other hand that's why we are here to offer an alternative to people. We cannot produce in large quantities like others but we are here to cut the middleman and other aspects in the cost by offering liquid that we created with our partners in France and by using the most basic bottle that is not expensive to source. 

After all, everything was made by a family business that's been doing it for almost 30 years!

# 7: How Is My Order Made and Do I Need To Mature My Perfumes After Receiving Them?

One thing people don‚Äôt know about us is that every order that you guys make is actually custom-made. 

***How you may ask?*** 

Well, each fragrance is poured down and made once you place the order. The fragrance is ‚Äúfresher‚Äù but it takes more time to dispatch the order.

We do it every day, nothing is pre-made and poured down, we don‚Äôt like doing that.

**Maturation** is a huge topic and it depends on so many things. First of all it depends how long has **fragrance** company held their creations before releasing and when it was mixed.Hot and cold temperature can make changes but so many things can happen during the transport and some **perfumes** can be too much exposed to the sun while transporting.

Chez Pierre's **fragrances** in 99% of the time don't need to **maturate** as we are always pushing them on the side to **maturate** before selling them. 

If you receive a  **fragrance** and you think it needs more time, keep it in a dark place and let it sit for some weeks/months testing them from time to time until the smell appeals to you.

&amp;#x200B;

# 8: Why Does The Perfume Smell Different From The Bottle vs On Paper vs On My Skin?

Imagine you are sitting down in your room with your friends (This never happened to me, I don‚Äôt have friends /s) and one of your friends is sweating more, the other has more pimples, one has softer skin while you have more fat or muscle under their skin. 

Do you think fragrance will stay the same on everybody‚Äôs skin and will project the same? 

**Actually NO!** Like the unique humans we are, we are all different and so is our skin.

Some fragrances project crazy good on one skin and smell wonderful, while on another skin it won‚Äôt smell the same.

This is the sad truth. I was so sad when I tested ‚ÄúBakar‚Äù, It didn‚Äôt smell as how I had imagined it to be on my skin. I gave a fragrance to my friend to try it and it was a completely different story. 

It was projecting 12+ hours and it smelled amazing. 

We have to face it that not every fragrance will fit us.

That's why when you smell the fragrance on the paper, it might not smell the same as on your skin. 

Smelling the fragrance in its liquid form means smelling the oils suspended in alcohol. The oils are unable to oxidize fully while in the alcohol suspension and therefore when smelling it in its liquid form, the fragrance does not smell ‚Äòfull‚Äô. 

This is why shops make you spray it on the tester strip paper as a baseline for smelling a fragrance.

# 9: Learn the words

### Accord

The resulting aroma produced by independent notes interacting with one another.

### Atomizer

The nozzle on a perfume bottle for spraying and applying.

### Body spray

Even lighter than cologne, spritz a body spray all over to add just a touch of fragrance.

### Blend

A term employed when referring to the way aromatic compounds are mixed for a harmonious fragrance.

### Clone Houses

Perfume shops or companies that are only dedicated to producing perfumes that smell like those you can buy in large chain stores, usually at a cheaper price. Chez Pierre is a clone house actually. We make fragrances that smell similar to what you can find in the store but with our own touch.

### Cologne

Cologne is a light, refreshing fragrance that you can splash all over your body. Since it's so light, don't expect it to linger.

### Decant

A popular practice within the online fragrance community. An enthusiast will buy a large bottle of a premium fragrance then sell small 10 ‚Äì 30 ml vials to other members in order to cover costs or make a small profit.

### Designer Fragrances

A designer fragrance is usually a perfume or cologne scent created by famous designer/s whose name on the bottle almost guarantees that many will want to try it.

### Dry-Down

The process of a fragrance cycling through its notes after being applied. It evaporates as it dries, which releases the aromas in a particular order according to their volatility. The overall experience is known as the ‚Äú**dry-down**‚Äù.

### Eau de parfum

This isn't as concentrated as perfume, but it's kind of like a perfume prep. Derived from pure perfume, eau de perfume‚Äôs formula is more concentrated with 15 to 20 pure essence. It lasts for around 4 to 5 hours.

### Eau de toilette

Eau de toilette is a lightly scented fragrance with a lower concentration of fragrant oils than pure perfume.

### Eau Fra√Æche

Literally ‚Äúcool water‚Äù, **eau fra√Æche** was a predominantly feminine accessory until recently. With a concentration similar to aftershave, a spritz is supposed to provide light refreshment. Today, it is often used to label summer flanker releases for fragrances.

### Essential Oil

A concentrated liquid that contains a volatile aroma compound extracted from plants through steam or distillation.

### Extrait de parfum (pure perfume, perfume, parfum, parfum extrait or simply extract)

**Extrait de parfum** (always called pure perfume, perfume, parfum, parfum extrait or simply extract) is the strongest scent available on the market, so it usually comes in tiny bottles and is very expensive. Its high concentration makes it more valuable. Apply perfume to your pulse points.

### Layering

The act of spraying multiple sprays of the same scent ontop of each other with the desire to make it project stronger off your skin.

### Maturation

**Maturation** (always mistaken with **maceration**) is the time required for a perfume concentrate to age or reach its full potential before being put into a base.

### Maceration

**Maceration** is the most commonly used method for removing the essential oils found in certain types of flowers (see ""*Floral*"" section in ""*How can I pick Perfect perfume for myself &gt; The Main Scents*) which are then used in **perfumes** and **fragrances**. This process happens by soaking flowers in warm fats and removing the oil. Once removed, it is then dissolved in alcohol so the extract of the floral oil can be used.

### Niche Fragrances

Niche perfume is perfume made by companies dedicated primarily to creating perfume, as opposed to perfume from fashion houses (often called ""designer perfume"") or famous people (""celebrity scents"").

### Notes

The individual scents used in the oil portion of the perfume. Notes come together to form an ***Accord***.

### Over spray

The act of spraying more than 15++ sprays in multiple layers all round your body so as to maximize longevity, projection and sillage of a fragrance. Often used with weaker fragrances so as to make it last a whole day.

### Perfume oil

Perfume or fragrance oils are the alcohol-free, all-natural types of perfume based on raw fragrant plant-derived ingredients.

### Projection

The way a scent is able to diffuse in the air of the wearer‚Äôs body.

### Pulse Points

Parts of your body where the pulse is readily distinguished at the location. Usually where an artery approaches the surface, making that spot a higher temperature than the rest of the body. The higher temperature heats up the oils when you spray on it and thus increases the projection.

### Reformulate / Reformulations

This became so common in the fragrance world. Usually, after a few years of the release of the fragrance, the house decides that they need more money or IFRA decides to change the regulation of some substance and the house decides to change the formulation of the fragrance.

One of the most famous (and everybody hates it) is YSL La Nuit de L‚Äôhomme reformulation. The

Fragrance before 2014 was one of the most interesting on the market but after reformulation, it‚Äôs not ‚Äòit‚Äô anymore. The sillage and longevity is not the same anymore.

### Signature Scent

Everyone has their own signature scent. It‚Äôs the scent that everyone remembers when you pass by or enter the room. My personal signature scent is ‚ÄúHint of Vanilla‚Äù as it projects so strong on my skin that the neighbor two streets away knows when I put the scent ;)

### Sillage

Sillage in perfume refers to the trail created by a perfume when it is worn on the skin. A fragrance does not need to be a heavy one to have a large sillage. It is not to be confused with its 'projection' (how a fragrance is perceived by others around the wearer) and is enhanced by motion, ambient temperature as well as the inherent qualities of the skin.

I picked out 'Encens"" by Rag + Bone because it was described as having a smoky incense-like profile, then I grabbed 'Oddity' on a whim as well. Encens is nice, but I think Oddity nails the incense vibe even better, and also reminds me of camping because of the woody notes. It is long lasting on the skin and I can't stop sniffing my wrist. It evokes a lot of warmth, spice, and smoke, and is very natural and down to earth. I think I will keep this one for me, heheh!"

1653816294,Perfumes,Welcome to my World ‚ôèÔ∏èüíó,
1653823094,Perfumes,hi! can you recommend scents for me?,"sooo hi! i'm quite new to perfumes, and i don't quite know yet what i like exactly...   in case it's relevant, i'm a 19F genderfluid kid so i don't really mind whether it'll be feminine or masculine :)

in what i do know, i will definitely stray away from wild spicy and vanilla scents because it tends to make me nauseous...   i'm still quite young, so i don't want to go to sexy and mature scents yet. i know fruity scents are my safer scents, but i'd like to check for other scents that i might like better. 

so far in what i've seen, i think i'm interested in le labo santal 33 and chanel no.5 (50/50) because of their longevity and sillage. zara tobacco collection rich/warm/addictive, alkemia deus ex machina, and chris rusak after every ounce of joy has also caught my eye, mainly because of their tobacco and motor oil notes, though i haven't got a clue where or how i'll be able to get it + i'm still new and this might be quite a big jump for me.

any help is greatly appreciated. thank you in advance!"

It took me 4 hours to photography my entire collection. No accidental drops or broken glass, so I pat myself on the back for that.

I got my first perfume, Harajuku Lovers Music, when I turned 13 in 2009. My love for fragrances was born. I bought myself Black Star by Avril Lavigne for my school¬¥s 2009 Winter formal. CK One Summer 2012 was a gift for my 16th birthday. I started to really get into fragrances in 2017 with my first well paying job: I bought myself Olympea Intense and Black Opium Nuit Blanche. 

I made a similar post a year ago, for those who want to compare my collections: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/msygat/my\_collection\_f24\_of\_over\_100\_bottles/?utm\_medium=android\_app&amp;utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/msygat/my_collection_f24_of_over_100_bottles/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

1654458256,Perfumes,Alternative to √î de Lanc√¥me?,"I love perfumes that mimic my favourite nature spots‚Ä¶woods, ocean, lemon. Fresh, approachable, down to earth.

1654462397,Perfumes,Finding a Leather Lesbian Scent?,"Have been brainstorming what I want to smell like now that my last perfume bottle is out (Rentless from Lush, too sweet for me now but nonetheless sexy). I need help. I'm a mid 20s sapphic that wears a lot of leather and the classic black Levis/wifepleaser. I'm a bartender, Aquarius, drive a manual, preferred drink is a Negroni. I read a lot of nonfiction. Not as sensitive and tender as I would like to be. I'm a no touch top, dating history is all women with severe Catholic trauma (not on purpose) and if its not absolutely gritty sloppy terrifyingly decadent, I don't want it.

I want to smell like: your fingers after you've made ten Old Fashioneds in a row, repenting for a sin so delicious that it will never taste as good as the first time, 90s LA lesbian hookah lounge, the towel I use to wipe off my hands when I change my oil, End of Evangelion, candle that's burned slightly too long due to an engrossing first date, the last sliver of amber getting driven into the horizon at dusk, tasting sweat from a lover's neck, exhaust ballooning out of an 87' El Camino, walking into the New Mexico desert never to be seen again. 

Likes: leather, resin, woody scents, smelling like a church but in a sexy way

Dislikes: sweet cloying scents, large sillage, vanilla, hyper-masculine scents

My spending limit is $180 and I'm in the US."

Also maybe it's because there hasn't been any major shipment of them going in, or production by viktor&amp;Rolf is not very big because i have heard is sold out from other countries too.

1654599836,Perfumes,signature scents for an alt/metalhead aesthetic?,"hi! i actually don't have much experience with perfume, but i do like to smell good and i'd like to establish a signature scent that fits my aesthetic. 

like i said in the title, i prefer to dress in a generally alternative way. think lots of black, fishnets, metal band shirts, leather jackets, ripped clothing, big chunky black boots, flannels, etc.

i'd like more androgynous scents that aren't too sweet. i had Happy by Clinique for a while, and i liked the fresh, clean smell it had. but it was a completely random gift from my aunt, so i was looking to find something a little more me. maybe something sorta dark and mysterious, something that smells like the mountains or backstage at a rock concert. i'm totally down with niche, edgy, offbeat kind of scents. i'm young and don't have a lot of money, so i would prefer scents on the cheaper end of the spectrum.

1654605623,Perfumes,Need more layering/blending ideas,"Okay, fragrance folks, I need some tips and suggestions. 

I have never had much success with layering/blending scents until now. I am 60 with drier (of course) skin and fragrances no longer smell as well or last as long for me - even oils. Now I have found this beautiful combo of Spears' Fantasy Intimate Edition and You from Glossier. 

When I first sampled Glossier's ""You"" (I think it was in a sub box), I fell IN LOVE &amp; had to have it. I got both the solid in a compact and a bottle of the perfume. I loved, loved, loved the solid but the bottled perfume was a huge waste of $60 &amp; I was ticked. I finished the compact (and thank goodness they have brought it back!) but the bottle has been sitting on my vanity. Every now and then I would use a spritz to see if aging made it better (it didn't).

The other day, I made a blind buy of Britney Spears' Fantasy Intimate Edition. Fragrantica's listing of the ""accords"" was everything I want in a fragrance - especially the first 4: vanilla, sweet, musky, powdery. 

I was really disappointed with the initial scent. Too child-like and sickly-floral on me. The dry-down was better but nothing like I expected. On a whim. I spritzed some You on top and... Good mercy! This is divine. The layering smells like the original sample (and solid) of You.

I need to try layering and blending fragrances more. This combo lasted for hours and hours - from 10-ish one morning until it muted down to a ""skin scent"" the next morning around 7 when I got up. 

I like those vanilla/caramel and powdery scents the most. Any suggestions are appreciated."

So it's a perfume that is kind of woody and i think musky, and the bottle has tentacles on it. I don't know if this helps, but a few weeks ago I saw someone on tiktok mention it and they were saying it smells like pirate ships and the ocean. Also I don't think it was very expensive, maybe ranging from 50 Euro to 150 depending on volume.

However, the dry down reminds me a lot of JPG Le Male, it feels premium and well blended, projecting and sillage is a beast, but Creed pricing $$$ I just cant digest paying premium for a 80s fougere.

As someone who is relatively new to the perfume world I think this scent is a great place to start.  

The sweet citrus and floral top notes lure you in and then dries down to a sweet soft caramel  that reminds me of waffle cone and fruity gelato. 

Wearing this scent I really feel like that sweet innocent girl next door and on a hot day like today I feel like melting ice cream. 

I was worried it would be too strong and sweet  but once it dries down I feel that it is a bit light. 

I was hoping for a stronger peach aspect but overall it's more of a strong caramel with a little bit of fruit. 

Overall I enjoy this perfume and think it will be nice for daily wear"

Naturally I was not in a state to try out all the brands, as I felt I was going to get a headache after nonstop smelling of fragrances. But even after trying many popular brands, I wasn't able to lock down on any brand and I felt utterly disappointed.

I felt many of the popular brands I smelled like Dior, Channel, Hermes, YSL, Pacco Rabana, Creed, etc were not anything mind-blowing or match the hype that many make them out to be.

Is it that I am too used to the one I have been using so I'm not finding any other ones interesting? Many a times, in public, like in the elevator or somewhere I smell some amazing fragrances of a person around or even someone that just passed by a while back and the smell that lingers in the air. I like those ones but obviously I'm unable to know what these are.

In the store, however, all the ones sprayed on those perfume testing strips or even on my wrists , felt too overpowering and I found it hard to make out the actual smell as I was constantly smelling new ones, with coffee beans in between. But still I couldn't detect what it would actually smell like on a person. On strips it's too intense, to the point I was almost getting a headache.

So I'd like to know how to go about looking for a new fragrance? Especially as someone who has stuck to using just one fragrance since last 11years. Should I start by looking for a similar smelling one? And gradually move on to ones with very different notes? I have been doing some research on fragrantica website.

Or should I take my chance with the popular brands with the hope I'd probably like them once I start wearing them on my body compared to smelling them off testing strips? There were some fragrances in the store I felt were decent, but I remained confused so didn't decide on any.

I know fragrances are a very subjective issue, so each one will like a certain smell differently. I'd just like to know the method of finding the perfect one. If someone who has or can share how they found their perfect perfume can help."

I love scents like petrichor and lilacs in the spring 
The smell of wet bark on trees and Palo Santo               and I enjoy sweet spicy stuff like cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg as long as they're not to dominant especially when mixed with citrus scents 

I don't really enjoy strong dominant scents like cedarwood, sandalwood, or rose but I wouldn't mind the cedarwood or sandalwood as long as they're not the top notes

I suppose I should mention that I prefer perfume oils as well I don't particularly enjoy the scent of alcohol in the sprays at least on me on anyone else it smells fine

1655093132,Perfumes,I‚Äôve been obsessed with this scent but I want it in a perfume,"If anyone uses Caudalie‚Äôs Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk cleanser you should know the scent I‚Äôm talking about. 

Sephora says the scent is ‚Äò100% sweet almond‚Äô but I always assumed almond had a slight bitter note, nothing like the soft, sweet scent of this cleanser. 

The highlighted ingredients are Sweet Almond Oil, Castor Oil, and Cornflower Water, so that could be why it smells a little different. 

Anyways I was really hoping to find a perfume, Fragrance oil, even body wash or shampoo that matched this scent because I have been obsessed with it, does anyone have any recommendations?"
1655093410,Perfumes,Help finding a perfume sample I got from Sephora,"I used to have this perfume sample that I got from Sephora a few years ago, I feel like at least in the 2010s.

It had no notes of fruits or musk or anything like that it was a very pure rose scent. But not artificial rose. 

That‚Äôs literally all I remember about it, I really wish I had more info. I really really like this scent but I must‚Äôve lost the tube at some point and I haven‚Äôt been able to recover it or remember the name of it. If someone could maybe point me towards any sense that they think it could be. I would really appreciate it, thank you!"

1655181113,Perfumes,My review of the Nest New York sampler pack,"This is my 100% completely subjective review of the Nest New York perfumes that come in their sampler pack, in order of least to most favorite:

Golden Nectar - 
Smells like a children's chewable vitamin crushed up with flower petals with a bit of oddly placed muskiness. Like it wants to be a sexy floral scent but it's too artificial. I think it would work better on some people, but not for me. 1 out of 5 stars.

Sunkissed Hibiscus - 
It's sweet, but has some notes that smell like old wood... Like someone spilled mango-scented sunscreen on an old dresser. Not for me. 1.3 out of 5 stars

Black Tulip - 
A sultry juicy scent. It would be a favorite, except there's a slight powdery-ness that reads to me like a faint whiff of a children's chewable vitamin. 3.1 out of 5 stars.

Citrine - 
This smells like if dew drops were candy. A watery and very subtle scent, mostly green with a little sweetness and a slight suggestion of citrus. I think it would make a perfect ""my first perfume"" for a sophisticated teenager, but for me personally I want more complexity. It's too boring to wear alone, but I could see mixing it with some other scents. In general I'd give it 4 out of 5, but for me personally it gets 3.3 out of 5 stars.

Indigo - 
Very grassy and fresh. As someone who tends to go for gourmand scents, I actually like this, which is saying a lot. I think the fig really helps, by giving an earthy creaminess to balance out the sharper green notes. Not an everyday scent for me, given my preferences, but I could definitely see reaching for it on a bright spring day when I want to try something new. Perhaps before going to a farmer's market... 3.5 out of 5 stars.

Wild Poppy - 
A lovely candied floral. The pear and jasmine notes give vanilla-like basenotes to balance out the sharp brightness of the raspberry. As it sits on the skin, it melts into a more gourmand scent, but with just enough green notes to keep it bright. A bit on the youthful side - I'll enjoy it now but probably won't repurchase as I approach my 40's... 4.2 out of 5 stars

Wisteria Blue - 
This smells like reading The New Yorker (I swear there are subtle notes of that exact type of paper in this) under a willow tree on a late summer morning. Flowers are blooming in a nearby garden. There's a gentle breeze, and a clear babbling brook nearby. I normally don't go for watery or green scents, but this is simply gorgeous. Bonus points for it blending with Oscar De La Renta's Bella Essence exquisitely - the combination smells the mist of a waterfall, and lilies. 5 out of 5 stars."

I've been looking for a certain perfume for a while now and I can't find it again. Unfortunately I have barely any information to go on, this is all I've got. 

\- Bought it around 10 years ago in a Douglas store in Germany

\- Payed less than 100 ‚Ç¨ for it

\- The bottle is round from the front and from the sides the width is is about 1,5 - 2 cm (less then 0.787 inch)

\- It is transparent, clear glass but has dark blue or black stripes on the sides around the round front. 

\- I think it has the word ""rose"" or ""ros√©"" on it.

Unfortunately, I don't remember anything about the scent. I know this isn't much to go on and I hope my explanation was understandable. Does anyone have any idea what this could've been?"

I was lucky enough to visit the Aftelier before covid... It was so nice to get a google notification and learn more about her!!!

https://preview.redd.it/prm49m4ctrw81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0523cba59aa84b3d11b05c9a54a3ecd6e236f7a

*Here's the start of the article:*

*A woman leaves a room, and her* *perfume* *lingers. She is gone, but something of her presence remains. The woman, perfumer* [*Mandy Aftel*](https://www.aftelier.com/)*, has slipped into another wing of her home in search of a relic.*¬†

*Scents are like souls, Marcel* *Proust* *wrote. They endure death and destruction, ""remembering, waiting, hoping...""*

*Fragrances are alive for Aftel, too. She calls them ""my friends,"" and once charmingly addressed a shelf of* *essential oils* *directly, asking, ""Is everybody here?""*

*Aftel is heir to a tradition that* *traces back* *six thousand years to* *Egypt**,  where incense was burned to purify sacred spaces. Later, in  Mesopotamia, the desire for more complex aromatics inspired some of  humanity's earliest chemistry experiments. One* *cuneiform tablet*  *dating to 1200 BC names the world's first-recorded chemist, a female  perfumer named Tapputi. From that era onward, precious fragrances  proliferated via the Silk Road, reached mass adoption in the ""Perfumed  Court"" of King Louis XV, and currently comprise a* *30 billion dollar* *global industry that includes Aftel's cozy atelier here in Berkeley, California.*¬†¬†¬†

*The seventy-four-year-old returned clutching a notebook. ""This is  it,"" she announced. The pages document seasons of struggle as the artist  attempted to recreate the precise natural scent of someone she had  loved and lost ‚Äì a perfume she would eventually name* [*Memento Mori*](https://www.aftelier.com/Memento-Mori-Eau-de-Parfum-Spray-p/liq-edp-mementomori.htm)*. ""The process mirrored the relationship itself,"" she confessed. ""Torturous.""*

*It had been a solitary period, reminiscent of the perfumer's  childhood in 1950s Detroit. Growing up in a synthetic miasma of  ""asphalt, detergent, and chlorinated swimming pools,"" the scents of her  youth were unfriendly ones.*"
1651397741,Perfumes,"SOS, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE TASTE","Hello, i -sadly- have an overly difficult taste 

when ever i go the fragrances shop i end up leaving with NOTHING , and if I'm lucky enough I'll leave with only one perfume that didn't actually caught my attention . 

What I'm trying to find is something that represents power, wealth, luxury , classiness, maybe a bit rebellion if that make sense . 

Something woody, floral but not too much , a bit sweet but not so sweet , not so spicy or so powdery 

I do know that in fragrances there's nothing such as (women's/men's ) but i want it to labelled as unisex or smell like one 

My blacklisted fragrances ( Dior oud ispahan , Chanel coco mademoiselle , Guerlain santal royal -i can only accept musc noble - , maybe Chanel no 5 and Gabrielle - although i smelled it only twice- , all the gucci blooms , CH Good girl)

The ones i find acceptable ( musc noble, chanel allure -is a meh ntb- , Gucci floral Eau Fraiche , White barn mahogany teakwood high intensity -ik it's a candle but c'mon- , stronger with YOU intensely )

I'd appreciate your help and recommendations ."

im not rly knowledgeable in the way of perfumery, but i'm trying to find a perfume to stick to / signature scent. problem is, idk what i like or don't like (general trends). my favorite perfumes (that i've tried so far, age 21) are guerlain's shalimar, tom ford's black orchid and the newest fave addition is narciso rodriguez's pure musc (which is quite different to the 2 previous ones, isn't it? i feel like it's more of a light summer scent). recently i looooved dsquared2's original (i don't care if it's„Äämale„Äãor„Ääfemale„Äãperfume btw). d&amp;g's l'imperatrice was alright too but too... sweet? mild? soft?? for me. i didn't like any of the bvlgari omnias i've tried &amp; i didn't like guerlain's insolence (too flowery).

1651690074,Perfumes,Signature scent help,"hey, guys so im a teen girl. I need a signature scent. my goal is to have people remember me by it and a routine I can stay consistent with. In terms of the scent I want to smell good, a mix of sweet and floral and just fresh/clean. Basically, something I can wear at school, at parties, fancy events, basically a signature to me so it has to be appropriate for all types of events.  I already have a lot of perfumes just have trouble choosing. 

Some of my favourites are: 

\- tease by victories secret (this is my favourite but I don't know what to layer it with and it barely lasts but the scent is my personal favourite. I am trying to pair it with the Brazillian bum bum lotion from sole de Janeiro and it smells good just really expensive.)

\- bombshell by victories secret (smells good but its a little fancier for school and that in my opinion let me know if you think differently)

\- heavenly by victorias secret (this is a super clean, non-offensive scent and I like it but I want a young sweetish floral hint to it too which it doesn't give me) 

\- I also have a lot of bath and body works my favs are a thousand wishes and champagne toast but I want something more unique for me so I'm not sure this is the best as it's very basic and not very long-lasting. 

Please let me know your thoughts as well as any cheap signature scent recommendations you have for me to wear everywhere. If anyone has any nice layering products with any of the perfumes I mentioned, Pls let me know!!"

I‚Äôve heard that it‚Äôs similar to Pink Sugar, but that‚Äôs about it. I found a description of it on a perfume forum, i‚Äôll copy and paste it below. hopefully you all can help me, because my attachment to this scent is strongggg. üò©üò©

1651965389,Perfumes,Dupes for Clinique Cocoa &amp; Cashmere?,"I have fallen in love with Clinique My Happy Cocoa &amp; Cashmere, this scent smells like comfort in a bottle to me and lasts on my skin 11 hrs and on my clothes over 24hrs. The only problem is, it‚Äôs only sold in one size, 0.5 oz. It‚Äôs insanely small. It‚Äôs also pricey being $25 for that amount. Apparently it can be used as a mix in with other perfumes or worn alone so I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so small. It almost looks like a body mist online but in person it‚Äôs a tiny purple glass bottle and it‚Äôs perfume quality. 

I‚Äôve never smelled another perfume like this personally, and I don‚Äôt really see anyone talking about it online. it‚Äôs described as an Oriental Amber and the notes are

‚Ä¢ Cocoa
‚Ä¢ Vanilla
‚Ä¢ Golden Amber
‚Ä¢ Musks
‚Ä¢ Pink Pepper
‚Ä¢ Jasmine
‚Ä¢ Honeysuckle
‚Ä¢ Solar Salicylates

It's not necessarily all smells that bothers me but specific smells. Smelling bad and some other stuff triggers anxiety and headaches (Just broken brain stuff). And I get over stimulated easily so having a familiar scent that I like wafting around really helps to ground myself.

I get migraines too, so I could never get cheap perfumes where the alcohol just hits you in the face. I also can't stand those ""ocean"" kinds as well as musky, woody scents.

I've been wearing BBW's Vanilla Sugar but it doesn't last long, it's just the only one from BBW that doesn't give me migraines because it's subtle and not overpowering. Plus back when I wasn't working, it's cheap haha

I like sweet, vanilla-y scents, the kind that smells yummy. Floral is ok. I'm willing to try fruity/citrusy as long as it's not super strong. Not so much a ""fresh"" feeling but more homely? Comforting smell.

I will be wearing it everyday. Don't really have a budget as long as it's not ridiculously expensive I'm okay with it.

Also I live in a tropical, humid climate that's sunny all year round and I'm not too sure if the malls here stock anything other than the popular brands, so I will probably not be able to purchase anything indie.

Thanks for the help!!"

I love Outremer's Vanille. It's my signature scent, I wear it consistently. My usual place that I get it from is temporarily sold out, and while wiating for a restock I found a larger version of it on Smallflower. Shipping was fine, the price was decent.

The bottle came with perfume everywhere and the spray smells nothing like the Vanille. It smells like window cleaner. I feel like I got a dupe. Left a review stating my experience, tried contacting support for a refund but couldn't get ahold of anyone. This morning I went to check and my review was deleted, despite confirming my email for the review. I have also not heard anything back from their Support.

I'm now stuck with a perfume bottle that lost a portion of its contents during shipment and it smells nothing like the Vanille that I'm used to. I'm really bummed out about this.

Has anyone else experienced this issue with them?"

1648631533,Perfumes,":) Recommendations for clean, fresh scents!","Hello! I‚Äôm hoping someone reads this and would like to give me (F20) a recommendation on a fragrance to buy! It would be awesome. I‚Äôm looking for a fresh scent, that is feminine yet not too flowery/sweet/fruity or musky/gourmand/oriental, also not too chemical, that you could wear to any occasion all year round. All price ranges. The ‚Äúclean smell‚Äù is so lovely, especially if it has a signature to it, like fresh sheets but more fragrance-like. My only concerns with this type of smell are that one would end up smelling like a 2$ soap if you know what I mean, I hope to avoid that, or simply smelling boring. Another smell I like is the woody, cedar type of smell which I guess contradicts what I previously said, but maybe there's a combination out there somewhere. The only fragrance I‚Äôve smelled for longer periods is Good Girl - Carolina Herrera, it was too musky/oriental/vanilla/chocolate for me and I didn‚Äôt really like it. I do have two smells I liked and became obsessed with, a pair of fragrance sticks, the scents are explained like this:

‚ÄúAntique Green‚Äù: A fresh herbal scent with notes of melon, peach, lily of the valley and cedarwood.

‚ÄúWhite Satin‚Äù: A clean scent with notes of orchid, jasmine, lily of the valley and cedarwood.

I know little about perfume so I hope I could explain the scent I‚Äôm looking for a little at least, hopefully someone reads and has a recommendation! Have a good day :)"

1648782306,Perfumes,Help me find the perfume of my dreams/memories?,"Hi everyone,

I have been searching for a very special fragrance for years, but because I can only describe it from memory, it has been a little difficult. When I was 9, in 2005 or 2006, my aunt gave me a sample spray of a lemony, rich, sweet, delicious perfume. I DOUSED myself in it because I was so proud to have a bottle of perfume, and because I was so proud that my aunt chose to give it to me. I recall it smelled like Italian lemon, maybe even a little like lemon cake, though I recall its tartness. I remember it being in a rectangular bottle, and perhaps this is a figment of my imagination, but I vaguely recall a lemon being on the bottle. This may or may not be true. All I know for certain is it was lemon HEAVY. Does anyone recall a fragrance from the 2000s that sounds like this? I would love to reexperience it."

1648998373,Perfumes,"Looking for a certain ""Christmas cookie"" type scent","About ten years ago around Christmas time, I was working distribution in a post office. As I was sorting packages I came across a scent that has haunted me ever since. The smell was coming from one of the packages, I think, but we were so busy and I never got to figure out which package it was before I sorted them all out to the carriers for the day...

It smelled like freshly baked sugar cookies combined with a kind of pine tree scent. And maybe a snowy smell-or what you'd think snow smelled like - But the prevailing smell was that of freshly baked cookies with sugared crystals on top. But also with like a pine tree snow smell. It's frustrating because I can't really explain it accurately. But I would know it if I smelled it again which sadly has not happened yet. I have tried all kinds of ""holiday"" themed scents from different places and nothing has come close. 

I am beginning to think that my memory has distorted how brilliant the smell was and perhaps it wasn't as magical as I remembered.  Does anyone have any suggestions? 

*it's possible that the smell was actually baked cookies being sent in the mail which is what everyone at work told me. But I really think it could've been coming from a bundle of magazines that had perfume samples in it (?) I mean that's a possibility as well. I swear it had like a perfumed quality to it that made me think that it wasn't actual cookies"

What I really liked about MK perfume was the primarily sweet floral scent. I want to literally smell like I bathed in flower nectar, honey, and sunlight. I think it also had a slight almost powdery undertone if I remember right. It was very feminine. My favorite perfume right now is Roses de Chloe which to me has a light sweet floral scent but is not too sweet. It‚Äôs absolutely wonderful, but it‚Äôs not quite perfect. Sometimes I mix it with a tiny tiny bit of vanilla scented perfume that almost exactly hits home for what I‚Äôm looking for. I think it adds a cozy warmth to it that gives it a little something something. 

I‚Äôm not super knowledgeable about perfumes so I‚Äôm sorry if my explanation isn‚Äôt very good. I spent two hours at Sephora with an employee who was determined to find the right perfume for me.

I was not planning on checking perfumes but I was super stressed at Zara, in line for a return, when I saw the bottle. The elegant and classic vibe really got to me and when I smelled it I couldn‚Äôt believe it, it‚Äôs old school and intense but feminine and mature, totally my kind of perfume. I was totally transported to my happiest place. I live in Stockholm and everyone here is obsessed with Byredo, everyone smells good but also the same, the range is very narrow. My favourite perfumes are Aromatics Elixir by Clinique and Infusion d‚Äôiris by Prada, so quite at odds with what‚Äôs popular around here (this makes me nervous every time I go to a perfume store, I don‚Äôt check too much). Anyway, I got the Zara perfume and it‚Äôs become my absolute favourite. I‚Äôm curious, does anyone know if it‚Äôs a dupe? If so, of what? Or, what are similar perfumes? I know what I like but I don‚Äôt know how to look for it so any advice would be great. Fragrantica describes the accords as leather/animalic/citrus/smoky. Other accords I‚Äôve noticed in my favourite perfumes are musk, warm spicy, white floral, amber and woods."

I really like the praline and raspberry in it. 

I'm looking for something similar to it. Not necessarily similar notes (although that would be preferable since it's discontinued and very hard to find nowadays), but just a similar vibe, if that makes sense - dark and sweet but sophisticated and not headache inducing.

I tried Black Opium EDP and Hypnotic Poison EDP and did not like either. Good Girl EDP by Carolina Herrera was just okay to me. I really liked Tom Ford Noir Pour Femme.

1646610438,Perfumes,I'm overwhelmed by what clones I should be focusing on making...so help me out: Which clone should I make next? And also what do you guys think of cloning high-end fragrances ? :),"Hey guys! I'm Nawar and I'm a huge scent enthusiast. You could say it's kind of my life's passion.

But you know what? The whole world of high-end fragrances has always felt a little too exclusive to me, and too expensive. Like, why should only the richest 1% be able to enjoy the smells that they want to wear?

So I did what any smart internet entrepreneur would do: I started cloning them.

Now look, I know some of you are thinking: ""That's not cool, man!"" But it totally is. And yeah some of ya'll be thinking ""This guy's a copycat!"" But let me ask you this: do you think Gucci copied Ralph Lauren when they came out with their signature polo shirt? No! They just saw something cool and wanted to make their own version of it. Some of these companies charge $400+ for a bottle of perfume that costs them $20-50 to make. And they'll tell you it's because they're using rare ingredients cultivated from the tears of unicorns or something, but please. It's all just marketing BS.

So yeah, my clones probably aren't going to smell exactly like the real thing, and yeah some do smell better than originals (at least that's what my customers tell me which is hilarious because it should be impossible haha), but if you want to try out some new scents without breaking the bank‚Äîor if you just think these luxury brands are charging way too much for their products‚ÄîI'm your guy.

I'm now overwhelmed with what to clone next, so I'm taking suggestions from you all and will choose my next project based on which fragrance gets the most upvotes in this thread. Don't be shy‚Äîplease suggest away!"

Backstory: Vincenzo Spinnato has developed a unisex fragrance by request of the Garland family to celebrate the 100th birthday of Judy Garland. It will be revealed June of this year at an event in LA and my girlfriend, Tori, has been invited to cover the event because she is a TikTok personality with a modest following. However her expertise is in Wizard of Oz, not cosmetic chemistry! 

Her and I have brainstormed various questions about the Judy connection, but we have no idea what questions experienced perfume/fragrance people would ask one another about their process. 

Here is Tori explaining the perfume release if you are interested:

I‚Äôd really like a warm vanilla scent without a crazy amount of floral. Although it doesn‚Äôt meet the criteria I have a tester of Mon Paris and I like the way it settles.

It opens up with sweet citrusy notes - Calabrian bergamot, Brazilian orange, grapefruit and pineapple. Then, the heart notes are coconut, damask plum, lily-of-the-valley, jasmine sambac, leather and RASPBERRY which give a tropical, floral and fruity scent (WOW, who thought raspberries can give such a special scent??) and this leads to an amazinggg dry down of a soft, almond-like vanilla caramel note.

Oh, this is a wonderful fragrance. I am so glad I got to smell this masterpiece.

1647260293,Perfumes,Exposed to a new beautiful fragrance :),"Ok so while my Euro trip I got exposed to this new perfume F.da Montefeltro by V Canto. 

It has a great opening of fresh, clean and citrusy fragrance with lovely floral, sweet, cozy and woody middle notes thanks to the ylang-ylang, flowers, amber and gurjan balsam. When I first sprayed it on myself, the first thing that I smelled were the flowers. Oh, that opening is so beautiful, freshy and obsessing. 

Then this beautiful fragrance dries down to a dark, soft, woody scent with a slightly pinch of vanilla which makes it warmer and cozier and feel like running in the forest while warm wind is coming towards us. In my opinion, the fact that it has vanilla in the dry down, yes even that pinch of vanilla, makes me fall for it not only because I love the smell of vanilla but also the warmth it gives and how cozy it makes the fragrance feel on my skin. 

LOVELY!

1647783986,Perfumes,How do you put perfume in aluminum bottles?,"Hello!

Ive been trying to make a pefume of my own recently for a school project, and i have a design in mind for the bottle where it would be made out of aluminum. Unfortunately from some quick googling Ive found out that putting ethanol in aluminum bottles isnt the best idea due to the ethanol in the perfume corroding the bottle which makes the perfume smell metalic.

Ive been looking for a way to prevent this and the two ways that Ive found to avoid this is to either put another bottle inside made out of a less reactive material like glass, which is a big hassle and effects the design of the product, or to coat the inside of the bottle with a thin layer of material that is less reactive to ethanol. I would prefer to go with the second option but through my research I havent been able to figure out what is normally used in this situation and i was hoping that the kind people on Reddit could help me.

An example of an aluminum spray bottle that has this coating: [https://www.cnshining.com/product/aluminum-perfume-bottle](https://www.cnshining.com/product/aluminum-perfume-bottle)

-warm &amp; floral
-more warm feel than citrus
-feminine
-not too ‚Äúspicy‚Äù
-on the sweeter side
-youthful
-hit more of the front to mid of palate, not too intense or hearty i guess?

Alongside discovering all this, I‚Äôve been testing different perfumes to discover what I like more. This is where I need your professional help- how do I describe this:
I love perfumes where you can easily tell what are the notes. Either where the perfume is focused on one key note, or if there are several they‚Äôre easily distinguishable.
A few days ago I was testing some BDK fragrances, and all I could describe them is kinda complicated? Lots of stuff going on, you can sort of smell a little bit of some things but everything is just blended together, this caused me to dislike it just because of how confused I was by it.
So, how do you call perfumes that are less that? That have less notes or are just simpler?
Does anybody experience anything similar?

I just bought the Versace Pour Homme EDT from a pretty big online retailer here in Belgium (bol.com), and I'm kind of suspicious of the packaging. I paid ‚Ç¨57,95 for 100ml (3.4 US fl.oz.). The plastic wrapping looks really amateuristic compared to other perfume brands I bought, and in the ingredient list every first letter of every word is capitalized (which looks weird to me). These two things made me very suspicious initially, but perhaps someone here can shed some light on my situation :)

The couturier‚Äôs Oriental reveries have in turn inspired CAFTAN, whose mysterious allure blends dark, velvety Incense with lush, radiant Benzoin.
Mysterious and vibrant, CAFTAN is a tribute to far-flung journeys

To me the incense really stands out and it is just the most addictive smell I‚Äôve ever smelt. It evokes images of old, mysterious churches/ altars but also smells so sexy and deep!

The notes are: 

Top notes: Bergamot, Petitgrain, Pink Pepper Oil

Heart notes: Neroli, Jasmine Sambac, Clary Sage

Base notes: Musks, Vetiver, Patchouli

Any help would be much appreciated! Thank you üòä"
1643589406,Perfumes,Black XS for her EDT vs EDP,"Hi there!

So, in the past I used to be obsessed with Black XS for her, and had the EDT and Black XS L‚Äôexces. They have been discontinued as you all probably know, but I may have managed to find a new bottle of the Black XS EDT (looks the same as it used to). 


However, I remembered that there is a new one, and it‚Äôs an EDP, so I am debating if I should just get that one. 

I have smelled both, and even though there is a slight difference, I would be happy with either of them, scent-wise. One of my most important criteria for perfumes is longevity, which is why I‚Äôm considering the EDP, but I do know that of course, it‚Äôs not always the case that EDPs are more long lasting than EDT. The old EDT used to be a beast in longevity. 


So, if anyone has had both of these or has some thoughts or recommendations, I would be happy to hear them! 

Thanks!"

Performance beasts like 1 million parfum, YSL Y EDP, Dior Sauvage EDT, Club De Nuit Intense, almost don't project on me. 1st hour moderate projection, 2nd hour weak projection, gone by the time it's the 3rd hour. Yes i get whiffs throughout upto 4-5 hours of YSL and 1 Million, but others can't notice anything after the 1st hour. I'm saying the above after multiple tests where I've stood at a distance opposite someone and asked them if they smell it with each step i take in front. They are either detected at close distance in the 1st hour...or very close at the second hour...and then almost like skin scents to others...and i might get whiffs till the 3rd hour , for sweet fragrances it's uptil the 5th hour.."

Has anyone purchased from Oil Perfumery, and if so, are the oils comparable to the original fragrances?

1641054845,Perfumes,Signature scent for my aesthetic,"I have been using Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gioia for a long time now but would like to try something new.

The Aesthetic I'm Looking For: Evoking an imagery of striking gorgeousness in a dreamy/ethereal way. Delicate yet commanding personality. Femme fatale but in a little sundress. Something that may also evoke nostalgia of a time gone by (like shalimar but not that strong). Of a time past that you long for but it will never happen again (say something classic or medieval or vintage). Something timeless.

I havent found any characters to explain what i am looking for but the basic idea i can give from historical novels is this lady who is very well trained with swords/martial arts but is also very gorgeous in a petite feminine way - strikingly gorgeous in an ethereal goddess way. I would like something that embodies commanding and imposing personality but a delicate feminine way of dress. Something that evokes a dark and cool nostalgia (in a dark academia way) but is also fresh (think grass, lime, mist, waterfalls).

A chilly, mystical and ethereal scent befitting the queen of the elves.

Notes I Like: Citrus, Aqua/ Water, Grass, waterfalls/mist, sandalwood, rosewater (so not as concentrated as rose), vanilla (not too strong but rather the lighter vanilla), snow, ice.  
I tend to get headaches from very strong or floral scents. I especially like those scents which feels chilly, fresh, delicate but still blatantly sexy/seductive.

I have been trying to find something like this for a long time but no success yet."

I dabble in perfume making as a hobby, I used to put 30% essential oils and top it up with an odorless oil (like jojoba oil). I was quite happy with the results. 

This time I tried to experiment with using ethanol. 
I put 30% essential oils, 40% jojoba oil as carrier, and 30% ethanol (perfumer's alcohol). I thought adding alcohol would help get better sillage and preserve the perfume longer.

I made the perfume but I'm not that impressed and I think the oils didn't mix well. Should I wait a couple of hours for the ethanol to do its magic and dissolve the essential oils? Should I have used alcohol and water instead of using a carrier oil?"

A few years ago I bought Madonna‚Äôs Truth or Dare for my mum. It was a blind buy, and I only picked it because my mum idolises Madonna- I lucked out, it actually smelled really good.

I tried to get her it again when she ran out, and by this point the prices were a lot higher and I was confused, did some digging and found it was discontinued. I managed to get her a smaller bottle for about as much as I paid last time.

Fast forward to now, my sister asked for it too. The price point it way too much for me now, even for the smallest bottle.

I googled around to find similar smelling perfumes but the ones recommended were even MORE expensive than what Truth or Dare is going for these days!

So I need your expert noses to help me find a perfume that is as close to Truth or Dare as possible while remaining in a less than ¬£30 price range. I‚Äôm not expecting miracles, I know at such a low cost, it‚Äôs not going to be exact, but we can try!

My limited knowledge of perfume has me understanding that there are different levels of scent, and I remember my sister describing it as flowery, so perfumes that are most similar in this aspect will beat out perfumes that maybe match other scents.

1641614920,Perfumes,"And Ode to J‚Äôadore by Dior, an old timeless classic IMO","I‚Äôve been meaning to write this for some time since I purchased my first ever bottle of this perfume a few months ago. However this perfume has been known to me for awhile. 

I distinctly remember seeing magazine ads (with the little smelling sample) for this perfume when I was in middle school like mid 2000s. I thought it smelled amazing. I desperately wanted it. I think I asked for it for my birthday not knowing the price but it was absolutely out of the price range for my low middle class family and again I was like 13 years old so totally appropriate for my hardworking parents to NOT buy me a $100+ bottle of perfume. 

I would seek out similar scents sort of subconsciously over the next few years. Magnolia and jasmine stand out the most to me. I bought a magnolia body spray from bath and body works and used that forever into my college years, it‚Äôs since discontinued unfortunately. I‚Äôve had other jasmine perfumes.

Fast forward many years I‚Äôm now 30 and making a solid income, honestly I‚Äôm in a financial position beyond my wildest thoughts as a 13 year old. I finally decide to achieve this small at the time unattainable dream and buy this perfume Ive wanted forever. Such a satisfying feeling. It‚Äôs better than I remember. Hothouse floral aromas. Great lasting power. And I‚Äôm a fan of Charlize Theron who I remember from the old ads but had no idea who she was at the time. 

It‚Äôs a pretty mature scent but at the same time brings me back to my teenage hopes and aspirations.

I know it‚Äôs been a classic for a long time but maybe it‚Äôs not as trendy anymore since I don‚Äôt see it mentioned much here and it never seems front and center in big fancy department stores. Miss Dior seems to be a more front facing line for them now."

I just bought a dior homme intense perfume for about 130‚Ç¨ from a very  renowned perfume shop here in Albania, I don't have any doubt about the perfumes authenticity but there was some discrepancy.
Under the box  it was written EDP as is should be, because homme intense comes only as EDP.
Meanwhile the bottle was as it should be and the cap aswell Homme intense., but under the bottle it was written EDT.
Te batch numbers correspondent as well.
The perfumes are quite similar so I couldn't tell which one is it. 
The box was sealed when I bought it 
I am asking could the batch numbers be the same from two different fragrances?
Could it be that it is an Homme EDP and only the Cap is homme intense.

it doesn‚Äôt help that i‚Äôm a broke college student and perfumes are expensive! 

i‚Äôm trying to stop buying full bottles and just get travel sizes, especially if i‚Äôm not sure i love them. but some of the full size bottles are just too cute üò≠ 

i‚Äôm definitely not into niche perfumes and don‚Äôt have a favorite type yet. still exploring and figuring out what i like. my first perfume was gifted to me by my sister. it‚Äôs Chanel Coco Mademoiselle. Although this perfume smells nice, it gave me a headache and just wasn‚Äôt right for me. I was also gifted Ralph Lauren Romance and Cartier le Baiser du Dragon. Again nice perfumes but not me. 

I went ahead and purchased Glossier You as an everyday perfume, Lanc√¥me Idole for something fancier. I love the dry down but dislike the citrus smell in the beginning. This is beginning to be more of my every day perfume now. I got Marc Jacobs Daisy because the bottle is so cute. Just purchased La Vie Est belle as well as a travel size of Olympea and Black Opium. Black opium smells so amazing!

-
My godmother gave me scented a√ßa√≠ beads when I was a child (at least 19 years ago) and they smelled absolutely magical and unlike anything I ever smelled.

As an adult, I realize the notes that get closest to it are sandalwood and jasmine. It wasn't a very sweet smell at all and it had no citrus or any other ""sharp"" notes. It was the type of smell you could just breath in. It didn't make your nose 'shut down' from the punchiness because it was very soft. 

I recently smelled [Fleur D'Oranger 27](https://www.lelabofragrances.com/fleur-doranger-27-134.html) by Le Labo and that gets close-ish but it has more citrus than the scent I've been searching for.

I usually wear a fruity smelling deodorant, right now it's the Secret nectarine solid one, and I use B&amp;BW Magic in the Air body wash (it says it's almond flower, white iris, and whipped vanilla scented), cocoa butter body oil, and cocoa and shea butter lotion. I also use Maui Moisture shea butter shampoo and coconut oil conditioner, as well as the Not Your Mother's Curl Talk foam and cream (plus the deep conditioner when I need it, they smell kinda fruity and floral, idk what I think they smell like but when I Googled it trying to find the notes people have said raspberry, grape candy, berry-ish, and ""like a drink with an umbrella in it"".

Some perfumes are light and only last 2-3 hours, others last so long that they become part of your clothes. Perfumes with a higher concentration usually last longer due to the fragrance oil inside the bottle. However, this does not always appear to be the case. The perfumes mentioned here are the longest-lasting regardless of their concentration to add to it, and they are also some of the [best Luxury perfumes](http://www.taifalemarat.com/en) for men.

**#1 Dior Sauvage** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Dior Sauvage ](https://preview.redd.it/ly26qv8qvi381.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63eaca177e21d300f4561d653a03d8ea67ed7296)

A fragrance already loved by many, which is also very popular. It earned a spot on this list for dropping it, and while it's just an Eau de Toilette, the fragrance is a beast. It has loud, vibrant bergamot at the top and a very citrusy scent. This perfume is made for all occasions and is known to please the crowd, however, this perfume is overused, so if you are trying to find a unique fragrance away from Dior Sauvage.

**#2 The King T-10**

With top notes of cardamom and pink pepper, you have a scent that leaves a trail every time you walk into a room, from Taif Al Emarat, The [best UAE perfume](https://taifalemarat.com/en/collections/taif-collection/2) that is so popular in the Middle East and for the right reasons. Middle Easterners like their fragrances to be very strong in general, so this one had to make this list due to its longevity and exposure throughout the day, and fortunately, this one isn't popular either. Luxurious Arabic perfume.

**#3 Acqua di Gio Profumo** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Acqua di Gio Profumo ](https://preview.redd.it/embu5gksvi381.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38d3fb4685fe7cdee98f6f5f5f91549d9a7b8dd7)

A stronger version of Acqua Di Gio, the best-selling men's fragrance, the DNA of this fragrance was much loved but unfortunately, it didn't last long enough. Therefore, perfumer Alberto Morillas decided to make a stronger version but this time he added incense as well, giving it a wonderful fragrance that is more deep and long, this fragrance is also all year round and also for all occasions. Definitely classic.

**#4 Dashing T-04** 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A true Versace masterpiece, it mostly contains fresh notes that are perfect for keeping you smelling fresh all day long. The complimenting factor of this perfume is great too, you can wear this perfume almost everywhere but it is also very popular so if you want something that is not normally found in every man's perfume collection, you may want to look elsewhere.

**How do I find my signature scent?**

Giving yourself a chance to truly appreciate if you are going to enjoy a fragrance is a key to getting your signature fragrance. ""Allow yourself time to truly experience the entire fragrance, from the top notes you smell immediately, to the deeper, long-lasting base notes.

1638903089,Perfumes,Looking for alternatives to Eau de Narcisse Bleu / Vettiveru,"Hi everyone, 

Does anyone has suggestions on both of this perfumes?

I'm fascinated by Hermes' Eau de Narcisse Bleu because it reminds me this peculiar childhood smell of not a freshly watered garden, but of  water sprinkled flowers. I would buy it again but for the price, I'm looking for something that lasts longer than this cologne series, which imo is appalling.

With Comme des Garcons Vettiveru I have the same issue, I know it's a cologne and I love it,  but it just disappears after 15-20 minutes. I have a few other vetivers in my wardrobe (Guerlain, Lalique, Hermes) but they do not have this fresh, ''forest soil after autum's rain'' note that Vettiveru has.

Getting my mom a perfume for Christmas but have been searching for a good one for a while. She has always used the body shop British Rose which was a simple rose scent but the formula was changed so she‚Äôs no longer a fan. I want to give her something that smells like actual roses, not too sweet, not too old-lady (LOL she hates vintage sweet candy scents) and just kinda fresh? 

Thank you so much in advance!!! And happy holidays!"

There‚Äôs 3 others in this ‚Äúset‚Äù of fragrances. They can stack on top of each other and supposedly mingle well together. I bought 3 of them and the 1 is going back. My only other real complaint about this (these) perfumes is the lid goes on really awkwardly and you end up spraying inside the cap every single time. So that‚Äôs a waste of juice in an already tiny bottle.


Anyone else try these yet? I know they are very new. Not even on Fragrantica yet. Lol"

1639120576,Perfumes,Malaysian made perfume- Untold STORY,
1639132806,Perfumes,"Zoologist ""Moth"" review","Moth is a powdery resin fragrance with a twist. Soft but complex. First spray is a very powdery amber/resin, reminiscent of your grandma's perfumes from the 80's/90's. Give it a minute and the myriad of other notes come waltzing in, one by one. Honey, nutmeg, saffron and soft iris are noticeable in the beginning. This fragrance feels soft but chaotic, there is so much going on your nose goes into overdrive trying to settle on any dominant notes. I suppose it's reminiscent of a soft moth haphazardly fluttering towards a light source, so Zoologist have done a great job capturing the essence of a moth in that regard.

Half an hour in, it's a lightly sweetened version of the opening. Soft powdery resin with some deep spices. A light musky rose and a powdery yellow mimosa floral note can be noticed. There is a shadow of honey that comes and goes. At the six hour mark, it's a light powder which reminds me of a dusty old closet. Moth balls come to mind here.

It actually feels pretty spot on in terms of it being a scent example of a moth, with the dustiness, the old fashioned amber and the spices. It ventures a bit too far into art fragrance territory for me to want to wear it outside the house, but it is an amazing art fragrance at that. It would suit those who prefer powdery or moody fragrances."

***Tiffany &amp; Co Rose Gold Eau de Parfum***

&amp;#x200B;

[Yes, Tiffany &amp; Co. makes perfumes too, in fact, rose gold is one of the most complementing perfumes for women, it gives off a fresh, fruity, floral scent.

***Acqua di Parma Yuzu***

&amp;#x200B;

[A very interesting fragrance when you first smell it, it leaves you wondering and curious like the journey you are about to take with citruses and bergamot with sandalwood, but be careful, this is a seductive fragrance.](https://preview.redd.it/z2h0f7dtl9581.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9233b993d1456473dff54f6373542830b11bb041)

I know Zara perfumes don‚Äôt last very long but they‚Äôre very afforadable. Some people say they last like a good 2-4 hours ish on them. BUT the problem is if I only buy Hypnotic Poison, though it smells amazing and has insane longevity and projection, I can‚Äôt use it for every season and occassion. However, If I buy 3-4 Zara perfumes, I‚Äôll have one for every season or for a certain mood and occassion (but doesnt last that long.) Soooo, what do you think? What would you do if it were you?

I want to be able to put the perfume on some sentimental items, since they remind me of the way my mom smelled, and her memory is very precious to me. Please let me know if there's anything that you can recommend for $50 or less (might be a crazy ask, but I am also poor).

You may wonder why I have put the [Rawaha Perfumes](https://www.buyrawaha.com/) on top, while many branded and well-known [perfumes in Pakistan](https://www.buyrawaha.com/) are trending. Let me tell you why!

From the beginning, Rawaha‚Äôs production of perfumes has been above average. In addition, it is always sold in the same quantity and is popular among the people of Pakistan.

One of the [best perfumes for women in Pakistan](https://www.buyrawaha.com/product-category/women/) is the [Rawaha fragrance](https://www.buyrawaha.com/). They contain a variety of natural scents. The vibe in these perfumes is unique that is not like the rest.

[Wasim Badami by Hemani](https://wbhemani.com/fragrance) is a great brand that offers more than just perfume. Interestingly, the perfume and body lotions are very hot and strong and ensure quality. Personally, I have used the scent of this brand, and I like them.

Light mist with persistent odor and aroma on the body; you will find it all under one roof. Dynasty is also my favorite, and it is priced at (PKR 2350). The amazing thing is that there are explosive floral mixed with the smell of caramel and are very sparkling.

[Saeed Ghani](https://saeedghani.pk/collections/fragrances) has been specialising in perfumes and skincare products since 1888. Additionally, what interests me the most is how they create cute, pocket-sized attar from renowned global perfumes! For example, you can get a special scent by mixing your favourite notes or fragrances.

You can get 212 Sexy and Chanel no.5 in the form of attar. They are oil-based, not alcohol. Want to know the price? Only 500 PKR! It‚Äôs really low.

In addition, they have their own perfume packaging, and you can pay extra to have the perfume in the perfume bottle.

**Our Pick**

This would probably be [Rawaha](https://www.buyrawaha.com/), as it is committed to the quality and ideology of customer service that represents the best retailers across Pakistan."

Recently, I started swimming in the public swimming pool. After the morning swimming session in the pool, I usually go to work, where I work in fintech.

&amp;#x200B;

The water in the pool (and the one in the showers) is heavily chlorinated. I smell chlorine after every shower. I tried various perfumes, but I was not satisfied with the results. Recently I sprayed Tokyo by Kenzo and I have to admit that it turned out to be quite an interesting fragrance marriage.

I am the biggest fan of Chanel and No.19 Poudre is not very long lasting but it still doesn't perform worse than Omnia Crystalline for example. I love the iris and green notes it smells like real florist shop and has feminine touch to it with that powderiness. Is Prada really better? If it has unisex feel I would stay away from it. I can't even see it at the local perfumery to test. I have been looking foe green perfume for years... So Prada is the only one I haven't tested yet and the Chanel one is a big love.

I've been searching for a nice, autumn-y perfume in ages, but so far, I couldn't find anything that didn't smell like either my grandma's super heavy patchouli perfume or an overly sweetend vanilla milkshake.

1637822799,Perfumes,I want to smell like semen &amp; sex - Any suggestions?,"So after having done some research, it doesn't seem like there is any perfume out there that aims to smell like sex, semen and female bodily fluids (correct me if I'm wrong though).

So lets say I tried creating a formula like this myself using absolute and essential oils, would it be possible? And what chemicals or natural oils would be similar to the smell of semen?

I think I'd also throw in a bit of red wine, tobacco, chocolate and authentic deer musk to spice things up further.

I think the first ingredient would have to be salt. Because semen is quite salty. But there obviously needs to be something more. Chlorine perhaps? How would you go about finding the ingredients? And how would you formulate this ""sexiness in a bottle""?"
1637837226,Perfumes,"The facts of smells, the strange, and the wonderful.","We can be addicted to a Luxury scent or loath it to the point where if we were to get a whiff of it we feel nauseous and sometimes even sick, but why is that? Study shows the way we perceive certain scents is heavily dependent on our emotions, for example, if you smelt a [Luxury](http://www.ramasat.com/en) Dubai Perfume on a day where you are very excited and overall happy you would most likely find yourself feeling excited and happy the next time that same scent were to enter your nostrils, however, if you had the first encounter with that same perfume on a day where you‚Äôve gotten fired from your job you might not be so eager to smell that Luxury perfume again this is because our sense of smell is very much connected to our memory and emotions. Put it this way if you love how something smells, you also love how it makes you feel.

What‚Äôs interesting about smells is not only can they make you feel something when you wear them but everyone around you as well gets a sense of the impression you are trying to give off, euphoric scents are everything when you are trying to court attention, Ramasat a luxurious Dubai perfume company offers some of the most intoxicating and interesting fragrances known to be a definite head-turner. Quick Luxury perfume fact: your perfume speaks for you in volumes.

 Gold we want to wear it, smell it and also have it in our possession with the Gold line collection offered by Ramasat all of that comes to fruition. With tiny pieces of gold in every bottle you are spraying on gold with every spray, tiny fragments of gold are going to be on your skin throughout the day.

The most **beautiful scents** work together seamlessly which hence gives us wonderful Luxury perfumes, put too many incompatible scents together and our sense of smell will be overburdened, and won‚Äôt find the beauty hidden behind a Dubai scent. With the mohra collection offered by Ramasat, you are getting three different products that smell the same but work best only together. Lotion to moisturize your skin after a deep cleansing shower, along with that comes a 50 ml perfume bottle that smells exactly like your lotion so your clothing can smell like you as well and finally musk oil to apply directly to your pulse points to smell and project your Luxury scent all day long.

A lot can be said just by the way you smell so strive to smell great everywhere you go, Ramasat perfumes will carry you like the horse that never stops running till it attains greatness.

I dislike very loud gourmand/fruity/vanilla/sweet fragrances - they make me feel like I'm suffocating. They are too warm for my taste.

Also, please don't recommend anything with too much patchouli or something spicy (ginger for example) - I seem to get a headache from these kinds of fragrances.

I'm also okay with powdery, citrusy and woody notes (if they are not too dominant).

Fragrances I really adore(d) are/(were):

- Pure Poison by Dior

- Omnia Crystalline EDP by Bvlgari (sadly discontinued)

- Gardenia EDT by Chanel (before the reformulation)

the start was really masculine and woody, but only woody. i believe it was sandalwood and maybe rose(?). then you would smell a little musk then the flowery notes would come to your nose. the perfume was nearly unisex and not because of our body chemistry.

Wearing a good fragrance is a great confidence booster. If you are looking to buy good scents, choosing original perfume online in the UAE is the best choice.

There are many different ways to apply perfumes, you can quickly master the art of using perfumes when knowing the right ways of it. To buy your favorite scents, you can choose Samawa and remain fragrant throughout the day.

**Here are some tips which can help**

1. The perfect time to apply your perfume is after a shower. After taking a bath, you need to gently towel your skin and spray the scent to your pulse points. In this way, the pores will soak up the smell and leave your skin smelling nice all day long.

2. You need to moisturize your skin so that it can absorb the scent. Moisturizing your body will also protect your skin from the irritation caused by the alcohol present in your perfume.

3. There are certain areas in your body where the veins are very close to the skin. Your body generates the most heat at your pulse points, and it can help intensify your fragrance and help amplify your scent.

4. Many people have the habit of instantly rubbing their wrists together after being sprayed on. Thus, you need to stop this habit as it breaks down the fragrance.

5. One can extend the lifespan of their fragrance by mixing it with unscented body lotion. You need to add a few sprays to the cream in your hand and then apply it to your body."

I don't really like it when someone i know uses the same perfume as i do (that applies to lotions as well, anything related to scent). I always try my best to get my hands on perfumes that others aren't using. My birthday is coming up and i wanted to change my perfume. My boyfriend said he'll gift me the perfume as he's currently working somewhere they sell perfumes at discounted prices. We recently went out together with a friend and that's when he gave me the perfume. I really loved the perfume. After searching for so long i was so happy that i finally got one that i loved, that suited me and that didn't gave me a headache (I'm quite sensitive to scents). My friend who came with us smelled the perfume, she said she'll buy  a perfume as well since they're at discounted prices. We went to mado and she sniffed some perfumes and finally got one that she liked. She asked my boyfriend to get that one for her. Today i found out from my boyfriend that he got her the SAME perfume he got for me and guess what? I'm SO annoyed. At no point did she ask me if it was okay for her to get the same one as me and neither did my boyfriend gave me a heads up that the friend asked him to get the same one. I'm so annoyed at both of them (the friend does not know yet, only my boyfriend knows). Is my frustration justified? I get it that she probably didn't know that i wouldn't have liked it and my boyfriend says he didn't know that i like to keep my scent unique (i highly doubt that, we've been together for almost 4 years). I just want to know if my frustration is justified. I obviously want to give them the benefit of the doubt but can't help feeling frustrated."

In november of 2016 I smelt a perfume, I am still looking for. The acquaintance who wore the perfume said it was Roses de Chloe. I now wear that scent a lot since I like it very much. I suppose I like rose scented perfumes in general.

I can imagine that the perfume I smelt in 2016 was rose scented. However it did have a very distinct note that I can't recognize in Roses de Chloe. I regularly notice it in perfumes when passing by people on the street - equally often men and women, so I think it's a ""unisex"" scent that is used frequently. I would describe it as deep, down-to-earth, even magical because the smell of it makes me so happy instantly although I don't have any memories of it that I know about. Maybe it's wood?

I smelt quite a few perfume testers but I never recognized the smell or rather that one note (maybe it's not just a note, but a combination that smells so distinct to me, but I don't think so). I did definitely smell it yesterday in Dior's Sauvage. I recognized the smell on the items around the perfume (I think a little bit got onto the surrounding make up brushes) and after I sprayed it on my wrist, I wouldn't have been able to identify it from just smelling the perfume bottle and having too much of it in my nose.

If you have any idea what I could be talking about, I'd be very happy to hear your suggestions :)"

1635327000,Perfumes,Older batches vs. newer batches,"Hey everybody,
I was wondering what you guys know about the age of a perfume and its performance.
I recently bought a 50ml bottle of tom ford tobacco oud with a batch code that can be traced back to a manufacturing date in 2017. Performance is quite disappointing when comparing to the sampler in my local perfumery. The scent becomes almost undetectable after ca 3h to my nose. Could this be because its already been a few years since its been manufactured?"

I've just started my fragrance journey and currently have a small collection consisting of Creed GIT, YSL Y and CK All. I'd really like to try new fragrances and figured selling decants/ vials will allow me to support the expansion of said collection.

Question is would it be better for me to get a few cheaper juices eg. Azzaro Chrome Extreme/ Montblanc Individuel vs more expensive designers such as Prada L'homme/ ADG Profumo.

TIA!"

My mom seems to remember the name of the perfume being ""Tommy Boy"" could it have been an old bottle of Tommy Hilfiger Tommy Boy? I don't know because anytime I look up 'Tommy Boy' I get new pictures of the fragrance. The shape of the bottle was oval-ish.

But there's a problem. My skin (and hair), for some reason, change every single perfume. It knocks out top notes completely and goes straight for a linear base note scent. Usually it's the exact opposite of what I'm looking for, which is frustrating.

I've tried moisturizing beforehand to see if hydration is an issue. No difference.

A few examples: 

* Yawahawda J-Scent attracted my attention for it's top fruit notes, its lactonic and green sweetness, etc. On me, it's straight baby powder and amber, nothing else.
* A snagged a sample of Princess by Kilian, excited for a sweet fruit scent. Instead it's heavy lemon benzoin, nothing else.
* Anything with citrus or florals ends up smelling like bathroom cleaner or a stinky bouquet, respectively. Always headache-inducing.

I just want to know more or less what to expect when I test a new perfume - not for every test bottle to be a shot in the dark. Does anyone else have this problem? Any advice or insight? It it possible that my skin just sucks for perfume? Thanks in advance."

1630674495,Perfumes,Finding the right scent,"Hello! I basically needed advice on finding the right perfume for me. I‚Äôve been searching for about a year and when I smell a certain perfume it smells amazing but never just right when I wear it. I just assumed that it was mixing with my natural chemistry and continued the search. Well I tried Libre by Dua Lipa fell in love with the scent and took home a sample. The first day wearing the spray I loved how it smelled on me and I was finally through with the search. The second day I sprayed this scent on me it immediately smelt different. I decided it was due to the packaging and maybe it didn‚Äôt keep well in the sample container. Well then recently I ordered a sample of vanilla vibes which is not the type of scent I usually go for. And the moment I sprayed this on me i fell absolutely in love. The smell lingered perfectly the whole day and I was so satisfied. The next day when I spray the same amount on the same spot, I could only smell that same type of scent that came from wearing Libre. To me it‚Äôs like a burnt smell. Very hard to ignore. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just the way it mixes with my natural faramones but I‚Äôve tried spraying on my clothes rather than skin but the same results. Are they any recommendations for something that will mix with my natural scent or a way to keep perfumes from mixing with my scent? I‚Äôm very clueless when it comes to fragrance and just want to find one perfect scent and stick to it :)"

I have an issue and I would love to hear from you if you are having the same issue.

I bought ""Flora Gorgeous Gardenia"" perfume from a Gucci boutique last week (new bottle not the old one). A week before my purchase I tried the tester in the store and it lasted for a long time. However, since my purchase I used the perfume for four times and it doesn't even last for a minute. I tried spraying it normally to my neck   then I tried a different approach by spraying on my wrists, behind ears and even to my hair according to tips I got from other people. It didn't last.

I thought it might be something related to my skin but I heard some other buyers having the same issue. I contacted the store about the situation but they couldn't give me a definite answer about is there anything I can do about the situation ( like return it, exchange it ). They will give me a call about it but before that I wanted to ask you all whether you had a situation like this and what is the procedure/ process of Gucci in these kind of situation?

Also, if I hear a negative response do you have any tips on how can I make the perfume last? I feel like I am spraying for nothing!

Thank you so much!"

The fresh aroma of sea waves crashing on the coast, the woody fragrance of the dense forests and a hint of fruitiness with the scent of apples. This exquisite fragrance, the Hugo Boss Green is made for those men who live life by their own terms and are untamed.

Bob Aliano created this cologne with an eclectic combination of fragrances of Green Apple, Carnation and Cedar. This daily use fragrance contains top notes of Mint, Basil and Apple, which then leads to a floral fresh heart note of Carnation and Sage. It finishes off with a lingering masculine scent of patchouli, fir and cedar.

#### PRODUCT OVERVIEW

* **Top Note:** Green Apple, Mint, Basil
* **Heart Note:** Carnation, Sage

1632310450,Perfumes,Perfume Parlour Review,"
This post is strictly my opinion and I have paid for all these fragrances out of my own pocket. I only order the sprays, unless I‚Äôve stated otherwise, as I find them to be the easiest to use and they perform more like the original than the oils. When I first get an order in I leave the fragrances in the fridge for two to three weeks to macerate before I review them or wear them properly. 

These reviews take a lot of time and effort to write up, if you would like to order from PP I would appreciate it if you signed up with my link below. You get **10% off** and I get a little kickback also: 
https://www.perfume-parlour.co.uk/login/=64924




**Card Red Surplus 1850 - MFK, Baccarat Rouge 540 Extrait de Parfum**


In my last order I got the non-extrait version of BR540 (Card Red) and really liked it. I read that this was a l more popular version and a bit deeper and denser than the normal Card Red. 

The opening is minty cotton candy as the original and the non extrait however I get a bitter smell coming through also, I‚Äôm guessing this to be the bitter almond but I‚Äôm not too sure since I haven‚Äôt smelled the original. 
In the dry down I find this to have more musk and overall this has more animalic profile compared to the normal Card Red. 

The performance and projection are excellent, projecting well for over two hours and lasting on my skin for 6-7 hours in total. To be honest I think I prefer the normal Card Red rather than this but still it‚Äôs a nice fragrance. 


**Overall: 7/10**




**Avalanche Rouge 0746 - Aventus &amp; Baccarat Rouge 540 fusion**


A fusion of Creed Aventus and BR540, wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect since this is the first fusion I bought from PP but I wasn‚Äôt surprised that I really liked this fragrance. I‚Äôm a fan of PP‚Äôs interpretation of Aventus and BR540 separately so of course I really enjoyed this fusion. 

The opening is more BR540 than Aventus, it has that minty cotton candy opening but after a few minutes you start getting the fruity pineapple and bergamot notes of Aventus coming through. The dry down is more Aventus rather than BR540 but you still get a hint of that burnt latex throughout mixed with very slight woody and smoky notes in the later stages. 

Projection is good but not great at around 1 feet and I was expecting beast performance but it‚Äôs okay at around 5 hours. 

Overall a good scent, it is exactly what you‚Äôd expect if you‚Äôve smelled both frags. 


**Overall: 7.2/10**




**Avalanche Fruity 0022 - Creed Aventus**

As the name suggests this opens with very fruity notes of black currant, bergamot and pineapple. The opening isn‚Äôt as bright or photo realistic as the OG nor is it as woody or refined as Avalanche Woody (another, more expensive, PP Aventus clone). The dry down remains fruity and bright throughout with very little woody or smoky. Overall the fragrance doesn‚Äôt develop much but has that Aventus DNA throughout. 

Projection is good at around 1.5 feet for the first hour then dies down shortly after. Performance otherwise is good, this lasts around 6 hours on my skin. This is a good scent however there are better Aventus clones available, namely CDNIM or even Avalanche Woody. 


**Overall: 6.8/10**




**Mirror 0647 - Amouage Reflection Man**


A floral but clean and soapy opening, this reminds me of Prada L‚ÄôHomme but with a more Middle Eastern twist. The fragrance opens with rosemary and pink pepper notes in the beginning giving a flowery sweet smell that still remains masculine. In the dry down you still get the floral sweet smell but the orris root and neroli add a clean and powdery element. In the much later stages the fragrance stays the same but you get more sandalwood but it still keeps that floral powdery smell throughout. Overall a very easy to wear clean and safe fragrance. 

Projection is good at 2 feet and performance was above average lasting all day on my skin, starting to die down by the 8 hour mark. 


**Overall: 7.6/10**




**Intensely Scented 1919 - Maison Francis Kurkdijan, Amyris Homme**


The opening reminds me of TF Neroli Portofino but less citrusy overall. The opening is very bright with fresh mandarin and rosemary. It has a clean and realistic smelling mandarin and instantly has beastly projection on my skin. You can continue to smell the mandarin in the dry down also. The dry down remains fresh and bright but you get some iris and a slight hint of coconut however I don‚Äôt smell any chocolate or coffee. In the later stages I get some hints of tonka and very faint depth with oud but mainly tonka. Overall this is a nice fresh but uninspired fragrance with not much depth. I think this would be hard to dislike and a very safe everyday scent. 

The projection is great at a good 1.5 feet for about an hour and I could smell this on my self throughout the day. The performance is also good at 5-6 hours. 
This is definitely going in my next PP haul!


**Overall: 8/10**




**Prominent 1799 - Tiziana Terenzi, Orion**


Straight away I can tell this is an Aventus inspired fragrance, this opens with a strong note of pineapple, bergamot and fresh fruity notes. I get a lot of woody notes come through after 10-15 minutes and this is what I imagine the ‚Äúoriginal smoky woody‚Äù batch of Aventus to smell like. The dry down is more similar to Montblanc Explorer with strong notes of bergamot and slight notes of incense too. 

I don‚Äôt have the original Orion to compare this to but from what I‚Äôve read the original is very similar to Aventus, as is this PP clone. 

The projection is good at around 2 feet for around 2 hours and performance is 6 hours before I couldn‚Äôt smell it anymore. 

Overall this is a nice fragrance; another Aventus inspired fragrance but this PP perfume smells high quality and has good performance overall. My only complaint would be that this perfume applies quite oily, I know a lot of PP sprays are oily however this is the only one I used which I could actually see 


**Overall: 7.3/10**




**Saintly S 1804- By Kilian, Angel‚Äôs Share**


The opening reminds me of Dior F√®ve D√©licieuse, I don‚Äôt get much alcoholic/cognac but a lot of tonka bean and some oak. I start smelling the dry down quite quickly too around 15 minutes in and it‚Äôs very strong praline and vanilla with a hint of sandalwood. This is a very gourmand, designer smelling fragrance and reminds me a lot of F√®ve D√©licieuse throughout. 

Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt smelled the original so can‚Äôt comment on how close it is but the projection is decent at around 1-2 feet but performance could be improved, I could smell it on my skin faintly after 5 hours. 

Overall a nice unisex designer smelling fragrance but nothing to write home about. 


**Overall: 7.2/10** 




**Glazy Flower 1805 - By Kilian, Roses on Ice**


I received a free sample of this in my last PP order and fell in love with it so I had to purchase a 30ml bottle to give it a proper wearing and of course this smells the same as the sample I received in the my last order. 

This has one of the nicest openings I‚Äôve smelled, it‚Äôs a very balanced and fresh opening with a cocktail of cucumber, lime and juniper berries. The juniper berries remind me a lot of YSL Y EDP, which is my favourite fragrance and give the fragrance a very mass-appealing blue smell.

The dry down keeps the fresh aquatic smell but adds some rose and sandalwood. The rose is very faint and I get slight whiffs of it as well as faint smells of gin. Unlike other rose scents this isn‚Äôt heavy or leathery and sweet but fresh, clean and this smells very designer. This is a unisex fragrance and I think it‚Äôll be greatly suited for a very hot summer day.

This is quite a generic scent and has an oceanic and aquatic smell to it - similar to Acqua Di Gio. I find it really pleasant however I understand this is quite different to what By Killian normally do. 

The performance is good but not great. The projection is good for the hour but this quickly fades after. This still leaves a great scent trail for about 4 hours and I can still smell it faintly on myself around the 6 hour mark. 


**Overall: 8.5/10**

1632788694,Perfumes,D.S. &amp; Durga I Don't Know What,
1632788985,Perfumes,Need help deciding on a perfume!,"26F in the Midwest. I'm pretty new to the world of perfumes. I'm looking for a good year round, everyday perfume, or a good spring/ summer one and fall/winter one, and one for my wedding next summer. For years the only fragrances I've bought have come from Bath &amp; Bodyworks or Victoria's Secret, and I'm looking for something a little more mature. My favorites have been B&amp;BW Forever Red (love the warmth but sometimes gives me a headache), B&amp;BW Golden Pineapple Luau for summer, VS Pure Seduction (my fiance loves this one but sometimes it comes off too sharp to me?) and VS Eau So Sexy (I love the apple and cream scents in this! Might be too sweet after a while though?). I liked VS Bombshell too but it's my sister's signature scent. I've looked through ScentBird and my first delivery was Juicy Couture Viva la Juicy Noir which I really enjoy, but it's not strong enough and barely lasts an hour on me. 

I've been thinking I want something fruity and fresh but with warm undertones. I also like the idea of clean, fresh scents, like what I'm hearing D&amp;G Light Blue must be. I don't like powdery scents or patchouli, and not sure but don't think I like musk either. My favorite scents I know for sure are: apple, caramel, vanilla, honeysuckle, peach, pineapple. Not sure what flower scents I like but do know I'm not a fan of strong rose scent in perfumes. I don't want something too overwhelming but that lasts for a while and is able to smelled when I walk past someone. 

I got a couple samples of some Imaginary Author's scents and so far really like Whiff of Waffle Cone as it smells like a good burnt caramel to me, but too warm for warm weather. I've been wearing Yesterday Haze for a couple hours now and am really liking it as well, but it might have to grow on me a bit still.  I have Sundrunk and Cape Heartache I still need to try, but from the bottle, Cape Heartache is like fake Christmas tree and strawberry to me, so I'm a little nervous for that one. 

ScentBird recommendations that I'm maybe interested in: D&amp;G Light Blue (from what I read you really can't go wrong with this?), Michel Germain Sexual Noir, DKNY Be Delicious, Vince Camuto Illuminare Intensa, Clinique Happy, Confessions of a Rebel Get a Room, Burberry Brit, Burberry Brit Sheer, D&amp;G Pour Femme, Marc Jacobs Daisy Eau So Fresh, Kenzie So Pretty, D&amp;G L'Imperatrice 3, and J'ador Dior.  Someone suggested La Vie Est Belle and I got a tiny sample of it --haven't worn it yet but a sniff from the bottle smells too mature/powdery for me.  

I hope some of this helps and isn't too much! I'd love to find my signature fragrance. Thanks for any suggestions or opinions!"

1628057415,Perfumes,Gourmands with superior projection and sillage,"I‚Äôve posted before asking about vanilla fragrances, but as I‚Äôve sampled different vanilla-based gourmands, I‚Äôve noticed that staying power and just power are not as strong as other types of fragrance. the longest lasting fragrance I‚Äôve tried is l‚Äôeau dissey. And that‚Äôs not sweet or gourmand by any standard. 
I didn‚Äôt try every fragrance suggested last time. But I would very much like to find one that is represented in reviews as Very powerful and long lasting
Ideally, I would love to find a vanilla powerhouse to use with layered florals or even a deeper fragrance like armani‚Äôs Si with a much sweeter vanilla or gourmand base. 
As of now, I may have to layer a deeper musky floral with a standard vanilla body spray. 
I also love coconut and chocolate, caramel, toffee, etc. My ideal fragrance has cassis, caramel, vanilla, sandalwood, musk, and jasmine. Maybe ginger
I‚Äôve tried princess by killian and that is the dragon I‚Äôve been chasing for months. It lasts 5 minutes on me. Yet; it was a great deal more pricey than buying a ginger body spray and a vanilla body spray and using them at the same time

1628181449,Perfumes,Xarmony: Ienari (Unisex) Japanese cologne intended to make you smell like a samurai. Contains hinoki cypress and Japanese orchids.,"**r/xarmony Ienari: The orchid samurai shogun of Japan. He filled the palace with orchid blooms. It opens with undertones of cherry blossoms and purple orchid gardens. It also gives off a regal masculine scent but can be feminine. Closing with notes of Japanese Hinoki Cypress.**

Samurai would wear incense in their helmets for battle, To ward off spirits, or distract the enemy. The power of smell is something never to be underestimated. How would you swing your sword at something that relaxes you? Would it slightly alter your senses ü§î? Can this increase my chances of victory? Life is a battle. Will this help me win?

I came up with the concept during Covid19. I had only purchased one game in 2019. It was called Sekiro. The game featured a lone samurai fighting to save a child lord. It also had lots of flower petals, smoke, incense, powders, and wines. Running through temples etc. It gave an aesthetic to life around the samurai as opposed to only on the battlefield. 

I also kept remembering the ""samurai that smelled of sunflowers."" (Recurring theme in Samurai Champloo.) 

I decided that orchids held a deep mysterious presence. One that gave off the aura you would expect of a samurai. It has a certain air to it that says death might be on the horizon. Yet you are at peace with this. Or it is moreso that you know the death is your enemy and not your own.

After researching, I found Ienari. I found that Japan, to this day, has giant orchid gardens: mainly the preserved  gardens left by Ienari. The exact flower is called Neofinetia falcata. It was so beloved by him that feudal lords would attempt to impress him by delivering their own personal blooms of the powerful plant. He would sometimes give them their own estate... I assume he would expect them to cultivate on said estate.

Only samurai were permitted to grow the flower leading to the name ""samurai orchid."" It became a symbol of nobility. Wealth. A mark of fine art and class. Luxurious.

Exactly what I want in a bottle. Or what I want to give others in a bottle. A small vivid piece of high society set in matching time and tone for men and women alike.

Fun fact: In 2005 a rare variety of Neofinetia falcata,aka samurai orchid, sold for $70,000. They serve as living paintings. In some cases, more valuable and treasured than original ink manuscripts from the Edo period!"

1628727344,Perfumes,Goth Perfumes,"Hello,

I am currently looking for some new perfumes with gothic/vampire vibes. 

I have always liked woody smells, the smells of churches and pine, incense. Something that would be similar to a religious mass. I am also not against a perfume with a sweeter scent like notes of amber, opoponax, ""warmer"" smells.

Just to give you an idea, here is a list of perfume I have already in my collection that could match what I want :

\- *John Galliano EDP* \- **John Galliano**

\- *Crystal Noir* \- **Versace**

\- *Eau d'Iparie* \- **L'Occitane**

\- *Poison* \- **Dior**

\- *Reve d'Ossian* \- **Oriza Legrand** 

\- *Cardinal* \- **Heeley** (not the pepper note)

\- *L'heure Bleue* \- **Guerlain**

I wanted to add *Vitriol d'Oeillet* \- **Serge Lutens** and *Habit Rouge* \- **Guerlain** but quite too spicy for the smell I would like to buy. Also, one last thing, I am not trying to find something with oud or spices in it. 

Thanks for your help!"

I know it's a long shot but does anyone have any pointers for figuring out something that smells similar? It's a common perfume I swear, as I've smelled the exact scent in other products before, but I just can't pin it. It's quite fruity but obviously describing smells is difficult so I won't go too much into detail. After a bit of digging around online it's supposedly a passion fruit, pear and freesia scent, but the pear and freesia perfume I have doesn't smell all that close to it.. Maybe the passion fruit is the missing ingredient there, but I honestly don't know!

If any of you folks have used this conditioner before and have any pointers please let me know! It seems to be a fairly common fragrance like I said, I've smelled it in other products and also I remember years and years ago my sister had a body spray that smelled exactly like it. It's got a bunch of essential oils and stuff like argan oil etc so maybe that is contributing? I've no idea lol

1629109729,Perfumes,Perfume recs for a coastal/seaside sort of scent.,"Hi! I use perfume every day, though I'm not particularly knowledgeable about it in the way a lot of people on this sub probably are so apologies if I come across as clueless! 

That aside, I've never really had a set, signature perfume. I am only in my late teens so I've just been trying new things out, receiving various scents for Xmas and such. In the past I have worn kenzo world, paco robanne pure xs for her, and im just finishing up on my bottle of modern muse (my current perfume) 

I'm going to need to purchase another once I've finished with this bottle, and although all of the scents I've previously tried are pleasant, I have a specific sort of scent that I am after and need some help finding something similar to my ideas. If anybody could help, it would be much appreciated! 

I've searched for perfumes with coastal, ocean type of tones, however most suggestions seem to fit more into the concept of a summer breeze or a tropical beach with coconut and driftwood and such. 

To sort of put an image to the scent I'm after, think more along the lines of English seaside, stormy beach, rainfall, blue, fresh and unisex (not super strict on this, I dont mind if it is more of a feminine or masculine scent, so long as I dont smell of lynx aftershave haha). I'm a massive lover of the beach and coastline, particularly in stormy and colder rather. I also love rain. So basically, I'm trying to find a perfume that merges these things together. When I say a seaside scent, I want to steer clear of summer and sun and coconuts etc! 

Would be great if the perfume isn't a super niche brand to make getting a hold of it easier. I would need UK shipping if it is only available online too, which may be relevant. 

This is probably incredibly specific so I'm not expecting a ton of answers but thought it would be worth a shot! Thank you in advance and again, sorry for how niche this is."

I used it all, despite its probable age, and was gutted to see that it has since been discontinued. I haven't used or thought about it in a few years now but something reminded me of it earlier today and now I would love to get my hands on something as similar as possible. I honestly think it is one of my favorite scents of all time and I've not smelt anything else even similar to it. 

If anybody knows of anything that smells as similar to boudoir as humanly possible, or better yet, if there is a way I can still get a hold of boudoir itself, it would be very much appreciated. There isn't any particular notes I like best from it, its just the whole thing as a combination. It is truly so divine (although probably too overpowering for some, understandably!)

1629862783,Perfumes,"Looking for a light, lemon-lime soda-like scent","Several years ago, when I started working full-time in an environment that never seemed to be a comfortable temperature, I picked up a habit of wearing a perfume to sort of trick myself into feeling warmer or cooler than my actual environment. I had a favorite Etsy shop that sold rollerball perfume oils, and they had a lot of scents I loved. Unfortunately, the shop has since closed, and I‚Äôm looking for a replacement for one of their scents.  

I generally lean unapologetically toward warm perfumes: sweet, spicy, woody, etc. As a result, I have plenty of options for cooler temperatures. The air conditioner is broken in my workplace at the moment, though, and it‚Äôs making me realize just how better-suited for fall and winter my collection really is. Light Blue is pretty much my only truly warm-weather perfume, and it doesn‚Äôt *quite* scratch the itch I have.  

There were a few scents from this Etsy shop that I loved in warmer weather (and I‚Äôd welcome recommendations for any similar scents). My favorite was a light perfume that was based on ginger ale, blood orange, and lemon; it was basically like smelling of lemon-lime soda, and I‚Äôd have sworn it could actually help make the hot weather bearable. Another good one was strawberry, jasmine, sandalwood, and amber, which, while sweeter than the ginger ale perfume, was also quite light. The third was frangipani, lime, pineapple, and sea salt.  

If anyone has suggestions for similar perfumes, particularly a cool, sparkling, sweet citrus-y scent like the ginger ale-inspired perfume (which was Siren Soap‚Äôs Nixxie, on the off chance someone might recognize it), I‚Äôd be very grateful!"

I recently visited Spain and i came across Ramon Monegal's eau de parfum called Faisa. I was amazed with the smell and i instantly fell in love with it.

The fragnance itself includes Saffron, Ylang-Ylang, Lemon, Cinnamon and Anise as top notes, middle notes include Agarwood (Oud), Rose, Raspberry, Jasmine and Mimosa; and base notes include Amber, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Tonka Bean and Caramel.

I was tempted to buy it however the price put me off at that time (‚Ç¨190). Is anyone aware if there are any similar (preferably cheaper) fragnances that have similar ingredients and smell?

Thank you in advance.

P.s it might be a silly question however i am new to the whole fragnance world"

1629926410,Perfumes,"Looking for fragrances similar to Lush's ""Light Touch"" facial oil","I recently bought the Light Touch facial oil (not a perfume,but a moisturizer) from Lush and i'm obsesed with it's scent. The website says the fragrance of the oil is mostly geranium and lavender but on the ingredient list, a few others like Chamomile, Olibanum and Myrrh are mentioned, as well as one mysterious ""fragrance"" that leaves me wondering what goes on that makes this bar smell so pleasant.

My problem is i'm very inexperienced in the world of perfume and I can't recognize any of the fragrance notes that are in this product. I don't even know what geranium smells like, and i don't smell a lot of lavender in it. 

But i do know this solid oil smells kinda fruity and flowery, and very fresh it's almost child-like, nothing like the usual Lush spice. 

Does anyone with any knowledge or experience with this product and fragrances, recognize familiar scents or could suggest perfumes with a similar feel?

Illipe Butter (Shorea stenoptera) , Kaolin , Kokum Butter (Garcinia Indica) , Irish Moss Infusion (Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract) , Meadowfoam Oil (Limnanthes Alba) , Organic Jojoba Oil (Simmondsia chinensis) , Organic Cold Pressed Grapeseed Oil (Vitis Vinifera) , Safflower Oil (Carthamus tinctorius) , Fair Trade Shea Butter (Butyrospermum parkii) , Silica , Fragrance , Witch Hazel Extract (Hamamelis virginiana) , Chamomile Blue Oil (Matricaria chamomilla) , Lavender Absolute (Lavandula angustifolia) , Olibanum Oil (Boswellia carterii) , Geranium Oil (Pelargonium graveolens) , Myrrh Resinoid (Commiphora myrrha) , Blue Spirulina Extract (Arthrospira Platensis) , Citral , Citronellol , Coumarin , Geraniol , Limonene , Linalool .

1630021063,Perfumes,Anyone know anything about a new Zara Jo Malone collection?,"I'm confused. I went into the Zara on Kensington High Street earlier today to see if they had a particular perfume in stock because I wanted to test it out. They didn't have it but that's not why I'm posting this. I'm posting because while I was in the perfume section, I saw what looked like a new Jo Malone collection. I think there were five of them. They had the same bottle design as the rest of the Jo Malone ones except this time the caps were metallic gold and had a vertical corrugated effect. I assumed they were new because I'd never seen them before. I tested two of them. One that had ""Oud"" in the name. *Something* oud‚Ä¶ Everyday Oud? I can't quite remember.  The other one had a citrusy smell. Again, I don't remember the name, Only that the name included a note that appealed to me. If I had to guess, I'd probably say mandarin? The only name I do remember is of one of the ones I didn't test which I'm fairly certain was called ""Leather Jardin"".

I'm confused because out of curiosity about this new collection, I googled it but I couldn't find anything about it whatsoever. Not even any talk of any upcoming Zara Jo Malone fragrances. I also searched through Zara's existing fragrances on Fragrantica and couldn't find anything relevant. I'm not sure if they're piloting a new collection in certain stores before fully releasing it or what.

Has anyone else heard or seen anything about these ellusive perfumes?"

But there's a problem. My skin (and hair), for some reason, change every single perfume. It knocks out top notes completely and goes straight for a linear base note scent. Usually it's the exact opposite of what I'm looking for, which is frustrating.

I've tried moisturizing beforehand to see if hydration is an issue. No difference.

A few examples: 

* Yawahawda J-Scent attracted my attention for it's top fruit notes, its lactonic and green sweetness, etc. On me, it's straight baby powder and amber, nothing else.
* A snagged a sample of Princess by Kilian, excited for a sweet fruit scent. Instead it's heavy lemon benzoin, nothing else.
* Anything with citrus or florals ends up smelling like bathroom cleaner or a stinky bouquet, respectively. Always headache-inducing.

The scents that I like are tropical scents, flowers, coconut, cinnamon and vanilla, root beer, &amp; probably many more. The best deodorant scent I've found so far is Old Spice-Oasis. And I havent found a good smelling body wash yet. I am a 27 year old straight man, but I have used female deodorants and female body washes before, just because they had a nice, sweet smell to them.

1625964377,Perfumes,"""Dupes"" for Chic by Celine Dion?","I'm looking for a better version (so ""dupes"" in quotes, but really the opposite) of this cheap-o drugstore perfume by Celine Dion. 

I think it's the white gardenia scent that i love so much - this one supposedly is watermelon and cucumber based, with the gardenia and then sandalwood and what not.

I've been buying and using it since I was a teenager (at least 10 years) and now its discontinued, although i can find it all over the internet. But, the bottle is also really difficult and awkward - not that big - and I have to buy it pretty much ""used"" nowadays, and it doesn't last that long which. Of course, it's cheap, and I've heard it referred to as ""alcoholly"" too, which i didn't notice but the more i think about it i kinda see that. 

So, anyway, i'm on the hunt for a better version of this. I just order some samples from a few recommendations i got like l'imperatrice by Dolce &amp; Gabbana, or Pacifica's Tahitian Gardenia and some others. 

And I love Marc Jacobs perfumes, but even those ones that have ""gardenia"" and are similar are still not quite what I'm looking for. 

So if anyone knows of a perfume that preferably smells *EXACTLY* like this one, i will love you for the rest of my life! 

I also found a website where you can create your own scent :) so I ordered something there - will see how it goes. But those are pretty limited as to what you can choose. Anyway, thanks in advance!"

Hello

I require to store perfume for long duration. I have found a glass jar to store it, as I read glass is best to preserve the perfume. I also have found a small 8oz fuel tank for RC cars/planes, which would be much better for my application (due to venting cap and mounting). I am however worried that the plastic will degrade the perfume, which I read online. However, if it is meant to hold fuel, and neither the fuel nor tank degrades, would it be also bad for perfume? I am new to this industry and need some advice on perfume chemical composition and reaction with other materials. Thank you."

1626281664,Perfumes,On the hunt for some perfumes that my husband and I both like!,"Hi all,

My husband and I have been together since 2014.  Since that time, I was hunting for a perfume that he would like.  In the past, I've sported the usual suspects like D&amp;G light blue, a few Marc Jacobs scents, Clinique Happy, etc.  

Finally in 2017 (one year into our marriage), we found two scents that my husband liked.  Both were from Soma.  The first was  Oh My Gorgeous¬Æ Vibrant‚Ñ¢ Eau de Parfum Spray, which was described as a beautiful blend of delicate white flowers, lilac blossom and sparkling pink grapefruit wrapped with a finish of soft white musk.  The other was Oh My Gorgeous¬Æ Passionate‚Ñ¢ Eau de Parfum Spray, which had a bold and unforgettable blend of mandarin blossom, sheer gardenia and vanilla orchid layered with rich, sensuous amber and exotic patchouli flower.

Eureka, these scents were perfect!  They wore well on me and I received many compliments from them, including the highly-coveted ""Wow, you smell so amazing and sexy"" from Mr. Husband.  Score.  So naturally, Soma discontinued these well-loved scents, in spite of many pleas from women like me not to do so.   I managed to snag two bottles of the So Vibrant before they sold it entirely (of which I just opened one) but I only have one bottle of So Passionate.  I've been in a mad dash to find some replacement perfumes.

Through my searching, I have figured out that he prefers citrusy scents over berry scents, so Jo Malone and Burberry Her are out.   He doesn't like gourmand scents, though I do occasionally sport Montale Chocolate Greedy when I'm hanging with my girlfriends because we all like the scent.  

He does like Replica Under the Lemon Trees, so I'm going to grab a bottle of that.  He likes By The Fireplace as a seasonal holiday scent.  I already have that, so it works well.   He doesn't like Jazz Club, though his office smells like it right now because I had the sample turned the wrong way when I was spraying it.  Oops.   I got a Replica sample kit some time ago.  

Anyway, so far Under the Lemon Trees is my only consistent win, but it is very spring/summery.  So I'm wondering if anyone has anything that may match the profiles that I've already given or something else I could try.   I've thought about D&amp;G POUR FEMME, but wonder if the sweetness would be overpowering.  Gucci Guilty Pour Femme is another one I'm considering.  Thoughts?

I'm not nearly as picky, though I try to avoid anything with a strong floral scent because the floral notes tend to override anything else on my body.   I can go from 30 years old to your grandma with butterscotch discs in her purse from 1985 real quick, especially with rose scents.  

Maybe I'm asking for a perfume unicorn, but these seems like a good place to start.  I appreciate any suggestions!  Thanks!"

1626478105,Perfumes,I want to talk about the first official perfume I created named Odinsleep. Please tell me what you think in the comments.,"Odinsleep: Ethereal Lush by r/xarmony

A fragrance derived from icy cold peppermint, tobacco and cis3hex (grass). I consider this to be my greatest creation. I have gone through at least 2 full size 100ml bottles of it already. I wear it every single day. It literally centers me in this world. As soon as it reaches my nose my world freezes. All is at peace. My ADHD mind takes a pause. It's like all of my synapses are finally communicating in perfect harmony. I am 30 and was diagnosed at the age of 5. In those 25 medicated years nothing ever made me feel more grounded and complete. I feel so calm and so peaceful. No anxiety. No stress. I can breathe! The air is no longer thin. The weight of the world has been lifted. A full reset and refresh. I feel this every single time. Your experience may vary. I knew when I made this it was right for my entire being. I only hope I can give this feeling to others.

It opens with a calming aura of silent snow fading into a strange indescribable correlation between grassy aromachemical cis-3-hexenal and coumarin. The final touch of vanillin with a blend of tobaccos makes this fragrance stand apart from the rest.

""It feels like the world has stopped. A relaxing moment in time. Like a viking smoking pipe  tobacco in the empty halls of Valhalla.""

A viking returns home from a long journey to find there is not a soul around. He knows not what has become of his people, thus is the mystery. He sits beside a fire in what he once called home and lights his tobacco pipe. A one eyed raven flying overhead drops dried herbs into the fire. This exact moment. This exact combination of emotion and smell. Is contained in every bottle of Odinsleep.

That is the best way I can describe it.

Yin and Yang. Xarmony balance the chaos.

IMO they are similar, sugary smelling, not very floral. Cheaper scents, they don't last as long as I would like. Basically looking for a ""name brand"" more expensive version that lasts a while.

1626918801,Perfumes,Hey everyone! I'm a Perfumer and I just wanted to talk about my fragrance named Odinsleep.,"Odinsleep: Ethereal Lush by r/xarmony

A fragrance derived from icy cold peppermint, tobacco and cis3hex (grass). I consider this to be my greatest creation. I have gone through at least 2 full size 100ml bottles of it already. I wear it every single day. It literally centers me in this world. As soon as it reaches my nose my world freezes. All is at peace. My ADHD mind takes a pause. It's like all of my synapses are finally communicating in perfect harmony. I am 30 and was diagnosed at the age of 5. In those 25 medicated years nothing ever made me feel more grounded and complete. I feel so calm and so peaceful. No anxiety. No stress. I can breathe! The air is no longer thin. The weight of the world has been lifted. A full reset and refresh. I feel this every single time. Your experience may vary. I knew when I made this it was right for my entire being. I only hope I can give this feeling to others.

It opens with a calming aura of silent snow fading into a strange indescribable correlation between grassy aromachemical cis-3-hexenal and coumarin. The final touch of vanillin with a blend of tobaccos makes this fragrance stand apart from the rest.

""It feels like the world has stopped. A relaxing moment in time. Like a viking smoking pipe  tobacco in the empty halls of Valhalla.""

A viking returns home from a long journey to find there is not a soul around. He knows not what has become of his people, thus is the mystery. He sits beside a fire in what he once called home and lights his tobacco pipe. A one eyed raven flying overhead drops dried herbs into the fire. This exact moment. This exact combination of emotion and smell. Is contained in every bottle of Odinsleep.

That is the best way I can describe it.

Yin and Yang. Xarmony balance the chaos.

I can't smell ""natural"" scents like flowers, fruits, trees, etc., but I can smell some chemically produced smells. Sometimes I can only smell very strong scents faintly (e.g., acetone has almost no smell for me).

Point is, I can sometimes smell perfume because it's chemical and not natural. Even if I can't smell it, psychologically, I like to wear it (not sure why).

There's no point in me going to a perfume store, because my nose would just get overwhelmed and I wouldn't be able to smell anything, but what kinds of scents would you recommend?

1628181449,Perfumes,Xarmony: Ienari (Unisex) Japanese cologne intended to make you smell like a samurai. Contains hinoki cypress and Japanese orchids.,"**r/xarmony Ienari: The orchid samurai shogun of Japan. He filled the palace with orchid blooms. It opens with undertones of cherry blossoms and purple orchid gardens. It also gives off a regal masculine scent but can be feminine. Closing with notes of Japanese Hinoki Cypress.**

Samurai would wear incense in their helmets for battle, To ward off spirits, or distract the enemy. The power of smell is something never to be underestimated. How would you swing your sword at something that relaxes you? Would it slightly alter your senses ü§î? Can this increase my chances of victory? Life is a battle. Will this help me win?

I came up with the concept during Covid19. I had only purchased one game in 2019. It was called Sekiro. The game featured a lone samurai fighting to save a child lord. It also had lots of flower petals, smoke, incense, powders, and wines. Running through temples etc. It gave an aesthetic to life around the samurai as opposed to only on the battlefield. 

I also kept remembering the ""samurai that smelled of sunflowers."" (Recurring theme in Samurai Champloo.) 

I decided that orchids held a deep mysterious presence. One that gave off the aura you would expect of a samurai. It has a certain air to it that says death might be on the horizon. Yet you are at peace with this. Or it is moreso that you know the death is your enemy and not your own.

After researching, I found Ienari. I found that Japan, to this day, has giant orchid gardens: mainly the preserved  gardens left by Ienari. The exact flower is called Neofinetia falcata. It was so beloved by him that feudal lords would attempt to impress him by delivering their own personal blooms of the powerful plant. He would sometimes give them their own estate... I assume he would expect them to cultivate on said estate.

Only samurai were permitted to grow the flower leading to the name ""samurai orchid."" It became a symbol of nobility. Wealth. A mark of fine art and class. Luxurious.

Exactly what I want in a bottle. Or what I want to give others in a bottle. A small vivid piece of high society set in matching time and tone for men and women alike.

Fun fact: In 2005 a rare variety of Neofinetia falcata,aka samurai orchid, sold for $70,000. They serve as living paintings. In some cases, more valuable and treasured than original ink manuscripts from the Edo period!"

I am currently looking for some new perfumes with gothic/vampire vibes. 

I have always liked woody smells, the smells of churches and pine, incense. Something that would be similar to a religious mass. I am also not against a perfume with a sweeter scent like notes of amber, opoponax, ""warmer"" smells.

Just to give you an idea, here is a list of perfume I have already in my collection that could match what I want :

\- *John Galliano EDP* \- **John Galliano**

\- *Crystal Noir* \- **Versace**

\- *Eau d'Iparie* \- **L'Occitane**

\- *Poison* \- **Dior**

\- *Reve d'Ossian* \- **Oriza Legrand** 

\- *Cardinal* \- **Heeley** (not the pepper note)

\- *L'heure Bleue* \- **Guerlain**

I wanted to add *Vitriol d'Oeillet* \- **Serge Lutens** and *Habit Rouge* \- **Guerlain** but quite too spicy for the smell I would like to buy. Also, one last thing, I am not trying to find something with oud or spices in it.

I know it's a long shot but does anyone have any pointers for figuring out something that smells similar? It's a common perfume I swear, as I've smelled the exact scent in other products before, but I just can't pin it. It's quite fruity but obviously describing smells is difficult so I won't go too much into detail. After a bit of digging around online it's supposedly a passion fruit, pear and freesia scent, but the pear and freesia perfume I have doesn't smell all that close to it.. Maybe the passion fruit is the missing ingredient there, but I honestly don't know!

If any of you folks have used this conditioner before and have any pointers please let me know! It seems to be a fairly common fragrance like I said, I've smelled it in other products and also I remember years and years ago my sister had a body spray that smelled exactly like it. It's got a bunch of essential oils and stuff like argan oil etc so maybe that is contributing? I've no idea lol

1623692204,Perfumes,[Storytime] How I traveled over 6500km to deliver the perfumes to the customers," Hello everyone Chez Pierre here,

Yes, this is based on a true story and this happened in February this year.

Let's go a little bit back, shall we?

It was 24th December and we were still restricted to send over some countries with Serbian Post, but we could deliver with FedEx. We were preparing to ship the orders that day but we got a phone call, telling us that we cannot ship with them anymore as they classified us as dangerous goods, and all operations should be stopped immediately with FedEx.

As Serbian Post didn't deliver to the Maldives I said fuck it and bought the ticket to deliver to them IRL.

It was a really impulsive decision at the moment but I didn't want to look back, as they were waiting for the orders for so long.

[https://imgur.com/a/D48eyDH](https://imgur.com/a/D48eyDH)

I invited some people to come with me, and the plan was for 5 of us to travel there.

As the customers were excited that I am going to deliver the perfumes IRL they ordered a bit more than they would usual as there won't be any chance to get perfumes in the next period of time.

So overall I had around 50 perfumes ready to bring but suddenly everyone canceled except my friend.

Few days before the flight I got a bit nervous since I had to carry many perfumes and if I got stopped by customs, I would return to monke.

[https://imgur.com/a/OmRSIZ4](https://imgur.com/a/OmRSIZ4)

(Picture I found in my gallery before going to the airport, it was 2 full boxes of perfumes)

Before I took off, I got an idea.

Why wouldn't I wrap the perfumes into aluminum foil, like drug smugglers do, so the scanner won't see the perfumes? Bad idea.

If you wanted to make the worst cover for the customs, don't do this, it looked so suspicious.

[https://imgur.com/a/tgyY8Ir](https://imgur.com/a/tgyY8Ir)

So we bypass everything and land on the Maldives and I am waiting to pick up my luggage when I suddenly notice customer officers standing on the sides and waiting.

I almost shit my pants when I saw them, even though I made a document with me saying that this is only for sample purposes, it wasn't the best feeling.

I got my luggage and saw some guy in front going with big boxes so I decided to go slowly behind him. My intuition was right and he got stopped by the customs and I just passed by and went to get a taxi.

After my friend and I arrived, I went up to meet with one of you guys.

Since there was lockdown in the Maldives and nothing was working after 22:00, we went to some shisha bar that's locked and only locals know about it. We had a great chat, smoked some shisha, had a few drinks. I brought many different perfumes and he was amazed as last time he got them in 2019 so the new ones surprised him.

On the last day, I had a flight late at night, so I decided to meet with one more RepFam in the capital of the Maldives. We ate some burgers, met with his friends, had some hookah, and overall really nice chat about their country.

Overall flying to someone's country and bringing them orders IRL is so much fun and I should do this more often.

That's why I decided to make Europe Tour or Mexico tour this August/September.

I cannot give much information as I got the Repfam jab and they are not allowing it in all countries.

Right now I can enter Spain for sure, so that's why I am waiting for other European countries.

If they open up by August, you can expect me on your doorstep soon.

Here are a few great memories from the trip:

 It's just, although they're great, and cheap I'd love something with a bit more staying power if possible.

 I'm interested in trying something new and have been on many perfume sites and reading the scent profile confuses me. 

I *think* I hate vanilla on me but I'm thinking it's the musk that smells off on me that many vanilla scents seem to have. I also really don't like spicy or sour scents either, if that helps.

So my question is, based on my *likes* is there a scent profile I should be clicking on and adding to my cart when online shopping and not able to smell it in person?

SCENTS I KNOW I LOVE:

I really liked calgon Hawaiian ginger throughout my teens as well as cucumber melon, sweet pea, and plumeria is a definite top scent for me. I believe there was an old amber scent from bath and body works I liked back in the 2010's but they changed the scent or it's just not the same.

 My ultimate favorite scent has always been Victoria's Secret Pure Seduction. ü§§

 Although I remember this Revlon scent (cannot remember the name and have no idea if it's even still in production) that was in a dark red bottle with black feather boa on the cap? That smelled crazy amazing as well.

I was wondering if anyone can tell me if they tried it, will it also completely smell like alcohol?  And would anyone have better recommendations?

I will literally go through a whole 30 foot aisle and smell each deodorant and body wash, and rarely I'll find one that smells good.  
The scents that I like are tropical scents, flowers, coconut, cinnamon and vanilla, root beer, &amp; probably many more. The best deodorant scent I've found so far is Old Spice-Oasis. And I havent found a good smelling body wash yet. I am a 27 year old straight man, but I have used female deodorants and female body washes before, just because they had a nice, sweet smell to them.

1625964377,Perfumes,"""Dupes"" for Chic by Celine Dion?","I'm looking for a better version (so ""dupes"" in quotes, but really the opposite) of this cheap-o drugstore perfume by Celine Dion. 

I think it's the white gardenia scent that i love so much - this one supposedly is watermelon and cucumber based, with the gardenia and then sandalwood and what not.

I've been buying and using it since I was a teenager (at least 10 years) and now its discontinued, although i can find it all over the internet. But, the bottle is also really difficult and awkward - not that big - and I have to buy it pretty much ""used"" nowadays, and it doesn't last that long which. Of course, it's cheap, and I've heard it referred to as ""alcoholly"" too, which i didn't notice but the more i think about it i kinda see that. 

So, anyway, i'm on the hunt for a better version of this. I just order some samples from a few recommendations i got like l'imperatrice by Dolce &amp; Gabbana, or Pacifica's Tahitian Gardenia and some others. 

And I love Marc Jacobs perfumes, but even those ones that have ""gardenia"" and are similar are still not quite what I'm looking for. 

So if anyone knows of a perfume that preferably smells *EXACTLY* like this one, i will love you for the rest of my life!

Hello

I require to store perfume for long duration. I have found a glass jar to store it, as I read glass is best to preserve the perfume. I also have found a small 8oz fuel tank for RC cars/planes, which would be much better for my application (due to venting cap and mounting). I am however worried that the plastic will degrade the perfume, which I read online. However, if it is meant to hold fuel, and neither the fuel nor tank degrades, would it be also bad for perfume? I am new to this industry and need some advice on perfume chemical composition and reaction with other materials. Thank you."

1626281664,Perfumes,On the hunt for some perfumes that my husband and I both like!,"Hi all,

My husband and I have been together since 2014.  Since that time, I was hunting for a perfume that he would like.  In the past, I've sported the usual suspects like D&amp;G light blue, a few Marc Jacobs scents, Clinique Happy, etc.  

Finally in 2017 (one year into our marriage), we found two scents that my husband liked.  Both were from Soma.  The first was  Oh My Gorgeous¬Æ Vibrant‚Ñ¢ Eau de Parfum Spray, which was described as a beautiful blend of delicate white flowers, lilac blossom and sparkling pink grapefruit wrapped with a finish of soft white musk.  The other was Oh My Gorgeous¬Æ Passionate‚Ñ¢ Eau de Parfum Spray, which had a bold and unforgettable blend of mandarin blossom, sheer gardenia and vanilla orchid layered with rich, sensuous amber and exotic patchouli flower.

Eureka, these scents were perfect!  They wore well on me and I received many compliments from them, including the highly-coveted ""Wow, you smell so amazing and sexy"" from Mr. Husband.  Score.  So naturally, Soma discontinued these well-loved scents, in spite of many pleas from women like me not to do so.   I managed to snag two bottles of the So Vibrant before they sold it entirely (of which I just opened one) but I only have one bottle of So Passionate.  I've been in a mad dash to find some replacement perfumes.

Through my searching, I have figured out that he prefers citrusy scents over berry scents, so Jo Malone and Burberry Her are out.   He doesn't like gourmand scents, though I do occasionally sport Montale Chocolate Greedy when I'm hanging with my girlfriends because we all like the scent.  

He does like Replica Under the Lemon Trees, so I'm going to grab a bottle of that.  He likes By The Fireplace as a seasonal holiday scent.  I already have that, so it works well.   He doesn't like Jazz Club, though his office smells like it right now because I had the sample turned the wrong way when I was spraying it.  Oops.   I got a Replica sample kit some time ago.  

Anyway, so far Under the Lemon Trees is my only consistent win, but it is very spring/summery.  So I'm wondering if anyone has anything that may match the profiles that I've already given or something else I could try.   I've thought about D&amp;G POUR FEMME, but wonder if the sweetness would be overpowering.  Gucci Guilty Pour Femme is another one I'm considering.  Thoughts?

I'm not nearly as picky, though I try to avoid anything with a strong floral scent because the floral notes tend to override anything else on my body.   I can go from 30 years old to your grandma with butterscotch discs in her purse from 1985 real quick, especially with rose scents.  

Maybe I'm asking for a perfume unicorn, but these seems like a good place to start.  I appreciate any suggestions!  Thanks!"

1626478105,Perfumes,I want to talk about the first official perfume I created named Odinsleep. Please tell me what you think in the comments.,"Odinsleep: Ethereal Lush by r/xarmony

A fragrance derived from icy cold peppermint, tobacco and cis3hex (grass). I consider this to be my greatest creation. I have gone through at least 2 full size 100ml bottles of it already. I wear it every single day. It literally centers me in this world. As soon as it reaches my nose my world freezes. All is at peace. My ADHD mind takes a pause. It's like all of my synapses are finally communicating in perfect harmony. I am 30 and was diagnosed at the age of 5. In those 25 medicated years nothing ever made me feel more grounded and complete. I feel so calm and so peaceful. No anxiety. No stress. I can breathe! The air is no longer thin. The weight of the world has been lifted. A full reset and refresh. I feel this every single time. Your experience may vary. I knew when I made this it was right for my entire being. I only hope I can give this feeling to others.

It opens with a calming aura of silent snow fading into a strange indescribable correlation between grassy aromachemical cis-3-hexenal and coumarin. The final touch of vanillin with a blend of tobaccos makes this fragrance stand apart from the rest.

""It feels like the world has stopped. A relaxing moment in time. Like a viking smoking pipe  tobacco in the empty halls of Valhalla.""

A viking returns home from a long journey to find there is not a soul around. He knows not what has become of his people, thus is the mystery. He sits beside a fire in what he once called home and lights his tobacco pipe. A one eyed raven flying overhead drops dried herbs into the fire. This exact moment. This exact combination of emotion and smell. Is contained in every bottle of Odinsleep.

That is the best way I can describe it.

Yin and Yang. Xarmony balance the chaos.

They don‚Äôt make anything else in this scent, but I would buy a perfume of this in a heartbeat. So I‚Äôm looking for recommendations for something close! It‚Äôs pretty descriptive - it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbeachy‚Äù (saltwater) rosey floral with just a slight hint of green and sweet. They are sold by Target if anyone is feeling adventurous enough to take a sniff. 

I‚Äôm a scent lover but until this year have mostly just done body sprays and lotions because I‚Äôm poor. I‚Äôm still poor, but recently decided finding a real perfume would be worth it since body sprays fade so quickly.

1) Where can I buy the same exact perfume/scent again? If they're still selling it, it probably has a different look/packaging now which is fine. I just care about the actual scent itself lol.

2) Is the perfume linked above the same exact perfume as this?:

That perfume on this second link shows up the most when I google ""Issey Miyake Eau de toilette pour l‚Äô√©t√© summer eau de toilette"", which are the words written on the original perfume that I bought lol.

1621614022,Perfumes,Something similar to Mademoiselle Ricci,"Hi, everyone! First time posting here. I'm not a perfume enthusiast, but I need some help from those who are!

Some years ago I purchased an 80ml bottle of Mademoiselle Ricci, and I **loved it**. Now I'm finally reaching the end of the bottle (I don't wear perfume everyday) and I wanted to buy another one... But it's not available anywhere in my country!

Due to covid restrictions, it's hard for me to go out and just try every perfume available in the stores. So, I'd like to narrow my search a bit. I asked around and I got recommended Flower by Kenzo. I was told it was made by the same perfumer, Alberto Morillas, and that it's really similar. The reviews I looked for sounded great and just like what I want.

In short, I like sweet perfumes that are not too fruity, but more floral, and not sweetish, if you know what I mean (I'm sorry, English is not my first language).

Do you guys agree with Flower by Kenzo being a good option for me? Do you have any other recommendations? 

Thanks in advance, and have a great day!"

*Dior Homme Intense* EDP opens with a moderate to a solid projection of powdery and purple floral notes. The opening is bold, elegant, mature, unique, and intense.

The iris is your opening most notable note. Within this odor may be described as powdery, visionary, floral gender-neutral, smooth. With a touch of purple and suede floral touch.

The iris is the characteristic note and put alone on peak of the touch lineup. A measure behind is that the ambrette, also referred to as musk mallow, a somewhat sweet, yellow flowery, gentle, slightly musky, woody, and boozy accord.

The musky nuance of this ambrette functions as a mild sharpening and fostering accord, but it is not animalic or pungent.

The lavender has subdued participation behind the iris, but the considerably more powerful iris clouds it. The cherry shaped, vetiver, and cedar are service notes.

## Recommendation: Dior Homme Intense EDP is available discounted for approximately $90. It‚Äôs a perfect fragrance with fantastic functionality for older men that love iris fragrances. This is a superb purchase."

I'm not sure if this specific one is just in Canada, but every few months Shoppers Drug Mart puts out a sample kit you can buy for $100. It has a sample of the most recently popular perfumes, I find it fun to try a couple new ones every day. When you pick your favourite, you can go back in for a full sized bottle. The prices of the perfumes range from $90-$125. Not the most fancy but I enjoy it :) I will list the ones that came in this box, as well as my notes so far, I'd appreciate thoughts that anyone has on any of them!

1622322433,Perfumes,Scents similiar to Slumberhouse Norne,"About three years ago I was hunting for a signature scent.  I stumbled across Norne; at first I wasn't sure I liked it, but I discovered that two sprays of Norne and a spray of Mendocino Midnight was PERFECT for what I wanted.

Now I'm hitting the end of my bottle of Norne and cannot find more.  I spent a good amount of time at an artisnal perfume company in SF yesterday, and came back with a few samples that stood out.

* Chris Collins, Danse Sauvage.  Cedarwood, cognac, a bit of vanilla!  Lighter and sweeter compared to Norne, but it smells nice and sticks around.  Lovely fresh cut wood scent.
* Rook Perfumes, Forest.  Incense, nom nom!  Lots of trees, pine and cedar, with a crushed ivy undernote.  This has the darker green resin quality I remember from Norne.
* Imaginary Authors, City On Fire.  Cardamom!  Smoke!  Labdanum.  Dark, smoky, sexy and dangerous.
* Chris Collins, Autumn Rhythm.  Another very green scent...like riding a motorcycle in a leather jacket through a redwood forest.
* Kerosene, Broken Theories.  Smoke, incense, oud.  A less potent blend of sensual dark notes than, say, City on Fire.

Forest is the closest I could find to Norne at this time."

Calvin Klein Obsession lingers foreverrrr on me but it can come across as very heavy and rich, but I'm only 26 and some days I want a lighter, less spicy scent. So many perfumes start great but fade quickly (I'm a nurse and walk around and sweat a lot). I LOVE Versace Eros Pour Femme and Dolce &amp; Gabbana The Only One but neither of them lasts very long. I love feminine, rich, not too crispy scents. Any suggestions for similar but long-lasting perfumes?"

A few years ago I got a sample of Mandarine Glaciale from Atelies Cologne and really loved it. I decided to ask for the travel spray for Christmas. I got the fragrance and it smelled so different. I realized that I had asked for Clementine California! I‚Äôm not the biggest fan but I‚Äôm a collector so I‚Äôm keeping it. Unfortunately they do not carry Mandarine Glaciale anymore so I‚Äôm looking for something similar 

The three that I‚Äôm trying to choose between are Atelier Orange Sanguine, Guerlain Aqua Allegoria Mandarine Basilic, and Guerlain Aqua Allegoria Orange Soleia

I‚Äôve read reviews, watched YouTube videos, looked at the notes but they all sound so similar and I‚Äôm not sure which one is the best, or which smells the closest to Mandarine Glaciale and less like Clementine California. 

If anyone has any opinions of these three fragrances and which they would rather have out of the three, I would love to hear your thoughts!"

1623692204,Perfumes,[Storytime] How I traveled over 6500km to deliver the perfumes to the customers," Hello everyone Chez Pierre here,

Yes, this is based on a true story and this happened in February this year.

Let's go a little bit back, shall we?

It was 24th December and we were still restricted to send over some countries with Serbian Post, but we could deliver with FedEx. We were preparing to ship the orders that day but we got a phone call, telling us that we cannot ship with them anymore as they classified us as dangerous goods, and all operations should be stopped immediately with FedEx.

As Serbian Post didn't deliver to the Maldives I said fuck it and bought the ticket to deliver to them IRL.

It was a really impulsive decision at the moment but I didn't want to look back, as they were waiting for the orders for so long.

[https://imgur.com/a/D48eyDH](https://imgur.com/a/D48eyDH)

I invited some people to come with me, and the plan was for 5 of us to travel there.

As the customers were excited that I am going to deliver the perfumes IRL they ordered a bit more than they would usual as there won't be any chance to get perfumes in the next period of time.

So overall I had around 50 perfumes ready to bring but suddenly everyone canceled except my friend.

Few days before the flight I got a bit nervous since I had to carry many perfumes and if I got stopped by customs, I would return to monke.

[https://imgur.com/a/OmRSIZ4](https://imgur.com/a/OmRSIZ4)

(Picture I found in my gallery before going to the airport, it was 2 full boxes of perfumes)

Before I took off, I got an idea.

Why wouldn't I wrap the perfumes into aluminum foil, like drug smugglers do, so the scanner won't see the perfumes? Bad idea.

If you wanted to make the worst cover for the customs, don't do this, it looked so suspicious.

[https://imgur.com/a/tgyY8Ir](https://imgur.com/a/tgyY8Ir)

So we bypass everything and land on the Maldives and I am waiting to pick up my luggage when I suddenly notice customer officers standing on the sides and waiting.

I almost shit my pants when I saw them, even though I made a document with me saying that this is only for sample purposes, it wasn't the best feeling.

I got my luggage and saw some guy in front going with big boxes so I decided to go slowly behind him. My intuition was right and he got stopped by the customs and I just passed by and went to get a taxi.

After my friend and I arrived, I went up to meet with one of you guys.

Since there was lockdown in the Maldives and nothing was working after 22:00, we went to some shisha bar that's locked and only locals know about it. We had a great chat, smoked some shisha, had a few drinks. I brought many different perfumes and he was amazed as last time he got them in 2019 so the new ones surprised him.

On the last day, I had a flight late at night, so I decided to meet with one more RepFam in the capital of the Maldives. We ate some burgers, met with his friends, had some hookah, and overall really nice chat about their country.

Overall flying to someone's country and bringing them orders IRL is so much fun and I should do this more often.

That's why I decided to make Europe Tour or Mexico tour this August/September.

I cannot give much information as I got the Repfam jab and they are not allowing it in all countries.

Right now I can enter Spain for sure, so that's why I am waiting for other European countries.

If they open up by August, you can expect me on your doorstep soon.

Here are a few great memories from the trip:

 It's just, although they're great, and cheap I'd love something with a bit more staying power if possible.

 I'm interested in trying something new and have been on many perfume sites and reading the scent profile confuses me. 

I *think* I hate vanilla on me but I'm thinking it's the musk that smells off on me that many vanilla scents seem to have. I also really don't like spicy or sour scents either, if that helps.

So my question is, based on my *likes* is there a scent profile I should be clicking on and adding to my cart when online shopping and not able to smell it in person?

SCENTS I KNOW I LOVE:

I really liked calgon Hawaiian ginger throughout my teens as well as cucumber melon, sweet pea, and plumeria is a definite top scent for me. I believe there was an old amber scent from bath and body works I liked back in the 2010's but they changed the scent or it's just not the same.

 My ultimate favorite scent has always been Victoria's Secret Pure Seduction. ü§§

 Although I remember this Revlon scent (cannot remember the name and have no idea if it's even still in production) that was in a dark red bottle with black feather boa on the cap? That smelled crazy amazing as well.

I was wondering if anyone can tell me if they tried it, will it also completely smell like alcohol?  And would anyone have better recommendations?

I was particularly interested in the vanilla and coconut variation.

Thank you in advance!"

1617349315,Perfumes,Perfume bottle design,"I was thinking about perfume bottle design and the trade off between originality and recognizability vs function. For example, there are some perfume bottles that are unique enough that they're pretty much instantly recognizable. In my opinion, examples include Carolina Herrera Good Girl, Ariana Grande Cloud Thank U Next or REM, Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy. There's a unique silhouette that makes it instantly recognizable. At a glance, people can say that the perfume shaped like a high heel is from the Good Girl line, or that the bottle with a bowtie and a giant crystal on the cap is one of the Viva La Juicy variants, or that the bottle with a cloud shaped base is Cloud. This helps a brand market their product as something more unique on the market. It's instantly recognizable as that brand and line. But on the flip side, I've heard from several people that they avoid buying these perfumes because of the unique bottle. People have said that the Good Girl high heel looks tacky, and I personally struggle with the sprayer on that one. Or that the Viva La Juicy bottles look very early 2000s kitsch and out of place on their perfume shelf. If you look at the regular bottles though, they are much more functional but I bet if I asked about a perfume with a rectangular bottle you could name at least 5 different brands that could be. These bottles include, in my opinion, things that while they have a consistent design thought that perfume line, are not unique enough that you can recognize it just from the silhouette. Stuff like Calvin Klein colognes, Maison Francis Kurkdijan perfumes, YSL Black Opium. For example, Chanel, Tom Ford, MFK, Gucci, and Burberry perfumes can be described as having square or rectangular bottles, very boxy with defined planes and edges. I'm not saying that every perfume from those brands fits that description, but a few sure do. The bottles are less recognizable based on their shape, but on the flip side you don't seem to have the problem of the bottle looking too put of place on your perfume shelf or any sprayer problems like with Good Girl. It's more functional than it is unique in shape. 

I want to hear other people's opinions or experiences with this, and whether they prefer a simple bottle that could be confused with a dozen others or a unique bottle that could have design flaws or look too out of place?"

1619042355,Perfumes,Where can I sell perfumes as a job ?,"Hello everyone , 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a self proclaimed fragranceholic , I live in Oman where there are no taxes and perfumes are sold at lower prices due to low rents etc etc. So I have the opportunity to buy and sell perfumes but I dont know where to sell them ! I have a small ebay shop and a small etsy shop. ( all authentic of-course) 

p.s I want to sell niche perfumes like for example baccarat rouge 540 ,intio oud for greatness etc etc 

The problem with ebay is final value fee so they charge 10% on total price including shipping and taxes leaving me with nothing...  etsy is okay but it doesnt really reach my target audience 

can anyone recommend a place and a helping a struggling seller in the era of covid-19 ?? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you let me know if you guys are interested in checking out my etsy stores !

Thanks everyone , Sara"

1619172933,Perfumes,Did i buy a fake tom ford?,So i got a soleil blanc tester off an instagram page. I just got it and it looks very weird. Right off the bat what i noticed from the box is that they slapped a sticker on it with the logo. It does say demonstration tester on the box too. The bottle seems to have the same golden sticker on it and the cap seems very light and a different material from the bottle. The bottle seems to be metallic and the cap is plastic. The smell however seems to be the exact same as the original. Was wondering if this is normal for testers or did i just get scammed?

1619193441,Perfumes,"Coco Chanel Mademoiselle. Love it, but it's so strong!","I've decided to treat myself and get some nice perfume. I first tried Coco Chanel, but was so disappointed. It smelled like something my grandmothers would wear. (I'm 51) So I'm giving that to my mother for Mother's Day. I then ordered Coco Chanel Mademoiselle. I REALLY REALLY like it. But it is so strong. I only used one spray, shared it between my wrists and behind my ears. That was an hour ago and I can still smell it, almost have a headache.

So my question is, what can I do to make the scent lighter? This is just one spray. I really want to wear this, but if it's bothering me, it will surely bother people around me."

1619433766,Perfumes,Perfume Parlour clone house review,"This post is strictly my opinion and I have paid for all these fragrances out of my own pockets. I only order the sprays, unless I‚Äôve stated otherwise, as I find them to be the easiest to use and they perform more like the original than the oils. When I first get an order in, I leave the fragrances in the fridge for two weeks to macerate before I review them or wear them properly.

&amp;#x200B;

This order was a mixed bag of new fragrances, repeat purchases which I‚Äôve re-reviewed, car diffusers and wax melts.

These reviews take a lot of time and effort to write up, if you would like to order from PP, I would appreciate it if you signed up with my link below. You get \*\*10% off\*\* and I get a little kickback also:

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Avalanche Woody 1848 - Creed Aventus\***\*

This was a new purchase and a blind buy for me as I haven‚Äôt smelled the original Aventus before, I decided to get the 60ml ‚Äúextract‚Äù bottle and the presentation and bottle itself is really nice and much better than the 13/30/50ml variants the sprayer is also heavier weighted and as a whole feels of much better quality.

The smell is very fresh, and I get bergamot the most on the opening. Unlike the name suggests I don‚Äôt get a very woody smell but there is a hint of pencil shavings as the fragrance develops and sets on your skin. This has some depth and develops the more you wear it and is definitely one of my favourites from PP.

The longevity and projection is great too and this lasts me all day and has got me multiple compliments and I will for sure be getting another bottle of this when mine runs out!

\*\***Overall: 9/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Agar Gold (Stronger Version) 0038 - Tom Ford Oud Wood**\*\*

A very spicy yet still fresh fragrance. This smells quite close to the original, but I feel like it has something missing and I can‚Äôt quite put my nose on it. The opening has a strong opening of cardamom and I get a very powdery smell from it.

The warmth of the vanilla and tonka bean come through in the dry down. The dry down is a lot closer to the original and both have that mass appealing warmth which I enjoy so much about Oud Wood. This will be great for evening and cooler days Autumn days.

The biggest downside with this clone is that the projection is good for about 30/45 minutes but dies down quite quickly and it becomes a skin scent around the 1 hour 30 minutes. This the worst performance of the bunch and although this is the ‚Äústronger version‚Äù it‚Äôs a terrible performer.

\*\***Overall: 7.4/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Bean Tasty 1604 - Dior Feve Delicieuse**\*\*

My first impressions was that this smells like Play-Doh. The lavender is very prominent in the opening and I get a little mint after about 5 minutes.

The dry down is very milky, nutty, and sweet yet isn‚Äôt feminine leaning as I thought. I get tonka bean and vanilla a lot too and I can smell some iris although it‚Äôs not listed in the notes. The dry down reminds me very much of Dior Homme Intense which is strange since their only mutual note is lavender.

I haven‚Äôt had a chance to smell the original, but I‚Äôve seen and read reviews that say this is a pretty accurate interpretation of the OG but of course doesn‚Äôt come up to par with quality and blending of the Dior private line.

The performance is okay, and the projection is decent too, but this doesn‚Äôt leave a strong scent trail. It more-so lingers on your skin. The longevity is okay too at about 4 hours ish on my skin, but I‚Äôve noticed with all PP clones they do get better with performance and longevity with time.

\*\***Overall: 7.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Card Red 1681 - MFK Baccarat Rouge 540**\*\*

In the initial spray I could smell minty cotton candy. This is a sweet fragrance but is also quite fresh. The opening is harsher and not as well blended as the original, but it still has that famous BR540 DNA and you can tell what it‚Äôs ‚Äúinspired‚Äù from.

The freshness stays throughout, and the mint smell reminds me off Mr Burberry Indigo. I know that mint isn‚Äôt a listed note in the original, but I know many people say they can smell it. Card red remains a thick and creamy scent throughout and this smells a lot more expensive than it is.

A very unisex scent which I think is suitable for any occasion or weather however I can see this excelling in the colder seasons for sure. I have smelled the original numerous times, and this is a very close clone throughout. Since the original is completely synthetic, I imagine it‚Äôs quite an easy fragrance to clone. My only gripe is that this doesn‚Äôt have that depth of BR540 but at a fraction of the price it‚Äôs a great purchase and I can‚Äôt complain.

The performance was okay on this, I was underwhelmed to be honest since the original lasts well over 8 hours on my skin. This projected well for the first hour or two but then became a skin scent and I stayed getting whiffs of it on my arm for 6 hours ish.

\*\***Overall: 8.4/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Exploding Aroma for men 0559 - V&amp;R Spicebomb**\*\*

A fresh opening with the clean bergamot and grapefruit this opens fresher than the original but is still a pleasant smell from the get-go.

In the dry down I continue to get bergamot but now with a little bit of saffron and pink pepper. I also get cardamom and some spicier notes, but it still remains fresh and doesn‚Äôt develop much further into the heavier tobacco and leather notes.

I‚Äôd say this is one of the worst PP clones I‚Äôve smelled. The original is a lot warmer and had a much stronger cinnamon note and was spicier and a more inviting. I‚Äôm going to let this macerate more and I hope it improves however so far, it‚Äôs the least accurate interpretation I‚Äôve smelled from them yet.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me, but I go nose-blind to this very quickly and projection and longevity on this is amongst the worse, I can‚Äôt smell it on my skin after 2 hours.

\*\***Overall: 4/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Leaf Flavour 0401 - Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille**\*\*

Straight away I get a heavy hit of tobacco and spices, I can smell clove specifically. This is very strong, and the smell almost punched me when I put my nose to it. Truthfully, I‚Äôm not a big fan of the original so I‚Äôm not surprised I wasn‚Äôt a fan of this however this does smell very close to the original TV.

The vanilla is mellow and helps balance the spicy tobacco notes in the opening. I also get some agar wood in the dry down which also helps the fragrance last longer and have that strong almost musky smell. In the dry down this smells identical to the original and I was smelling them side by side. By the 6/7 hour mark I was only getting vanilla.

This is one of the most accurate PP clones I‚Äôve smelled, and I can understand the praise this has. I would recommend this more to an older audience and it is masculine leaning however both men and women could pull this off. I like this a lot more as a candle/wax melt (see below). This fragrance doesn‚Äôt suit my personality or style so I won‚Äôt be getting another bottle but, in the future, I think a more mature me will appreciate this.

The performance on this is amazing. This lasted over 24 hours on my clothes and projects for well over 6 hours on my skin.

\*\***Overall: 5/10 (very good clone I‚Äôm just not a fan of the fragrance itself)**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Sweet Water for men 1262 - AdG Profumo**\*\*

A very fresh and oceanic seawater and sunlight fragrance. This PP clone is very close to the original with a bright and balanced opening. The freshness of the original isn‚Äôt fully there but it is close enough and for the price does a great job.

After 15-20 minutes once the top notes die down it smells almost identical to the original with the sage and rosemary. Where they differ is that I get more patchouli in the PP whereas the original Profumo is smokier with more incense.

The projection on this is okay and it projects well on my skin, but the longevity is terrible and doesn‚Äôt last as long as the original. But, again as with the Oud Wood clone since it‚Äôs so much cheaper than the OG you can go a bit heavier on the sprayer. I was getting decent projection for the first 30 minutes but after that you really struggle to smell this unless your bury your nose into your skin.

\*\***Overall: 7.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Sweet Milan for men 1418 - Armani Code Profumo**\*\*

A sweet yet fresh scent with an initial burst of apple and mandarin. The green apple is very realistic smelling and almost reminds me the mint and pear in Ultra Male. The cardamom is there too but it‚Äôs very faint and if I didn‚Äôt know the note breakdown, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to recognise it.

In the dry down I mainly smell amber and faint whiffs of lavender and the orange blossom. In the dry down this remains fresh and sweet but doesn‚Äôt develop much further. This nails the Code DNA and smells very similar to the original Code Profumo after 30 minutes.

The performance is good and projects well for the first 30 minutes to an hour but after that this became a skin scent on me, and I could smell it faintly after 4 hours. The original is stronger throughout and lasts longer on me too.

\*\***Overall: 8.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***NB: I don‚Äôt have, nor have smelled, the originals of the following three fragrances. These were free samples included in my order which I chose randomly. These aren‚Äôt fragrances I‚Äôd ever pick myself, so I thought to try something out of my comfort zone.**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Leaf Citrus 1814 - Byredo Tobacco Mandarin**\*\*

In the initial spray I get the spicy and fresh notes of the coriander and cumin with a background of mandarin. This is a very smothering and heavy fragrance with an air of freshness to it.

In the dry down I get a lot of sandalwood and Tobacco with a bit of leather, I don‚Äôt have the original to compare so I can‚Äôt comment on how close it is. This fragrance keeps the mandarin at the front and makes me think of walking through a mandarin field in a wet and humid climate. It has an earthy smell in it too from the coriander and cumin. This is very different from anything else I‚Äôve smelled and definitely not your average designer fragrance.

I don‚Äôt like nor dislike this fragrance, it‚Äôs nice in the dry down but very pungent and polarising in the opening.

In the first 30 minutes this projects very well but quickly dries down to become a skin scent. At the 1 hour 30 mark I can only smell sandalwood and faint mandarin. But it continues to linger close to my skin throughout the day but loses projection.

\*\***Overall: 6.2/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Venice 1788 - Tiziana Terenzi Casanova**\*\*

In the opening I straight away get a blast of bergamot and jasmine with powdery notes which give it a make-up type smell too. This shocked me as from the nozzle this smelled like a McDonalds Fish Fillet but spraying it on my arm I was pleasantly surprised with a fresh and flowery smell.

In the dry down I continue to get bergamot and jasmine but now with sweetness and rose of the pink pepper. This, alongside the vanilla, is definitely the best part of the perfume and makes wearing it very enjoyable. Further into the dry down I get more amber and tonka bean, and I can smell some sandalwood too although that‚Äôs not in the note breakdown, which adds some needed depth to this fragrance. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have the original to compare this so I can‚Äôt comment on how accurate this is but from reading reviews of the OG online I feel like this is a good comparison.

Although I am a fan of this, I won‚Äôt be getting a bottle for myself as it is quite feminine leaning. A great scent none the less!

The projection on this was excellent and left a strong scent trail throughout the day.

\*\***Overall: 7.3/10\***\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Glazy Flower 1805 - Killian Roses on Ice**\*\*

This has one of the nicest openings I‚Äôve smelled, it‚Äôs a very balanced and fresh opening with a cocktail of cucumber, lime, and juniper berries. The juniper berries remind me a lot of YSL Y EDP, which is my favourite fragrance and give the fragrance a very mass-appealing blue smell.

Unfortunately, this is another one I don‚Äôt have a sample to compare to so I cannot comment on how accurate it is.

The dry down keeps the fresh aquatic smell but adds some rose and sandalwood. The rose is very faint, and I get slight whiffs of it as well as faint smells of gin. Unlike other rose scents this isn‚Äôt heavy or leathery and sweet but fresh, clean and this smells very designer. This is a unisex fragrance and I think it‚Äôll be greatly suited for a very hot summer day.

This is quite a generic scent and has an oceanic and aquatic smell to it - similar to Acqua Di Gio. I find it really pleasant however I understand this is quite different to what By Killian normally do.

The performance is good but not great. The projection is good for the hour, but this quickly fades after. This still leaves a great scent trail for about 4 hours and I can still smell it faintly on myself around the 6-hour mark.

Out of these three fragrances I‚Äôve tried, I think I‚Äôll be adding this to my list and be getting a 30ml bottle in my next order!

\*\***Overall: 8.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Women‚Äôs fragrances**:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

All these below were purchased for my mum for her to wear to work, she has the originals of all of these, so I was able to directly compare them. I tried these all myself so bear in mind these are my opinions and I know I‚Äôm not the target audience for these fragrances.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Florence Notorious II for women 0234 - Gucci Guilty for her**\*\*

Straight away in the opening I get a floral lilac and patchouli scent. It‚Äôs very close to the original in the opening and has that soapy and almost make up type smell to it - very feminine and powdery. It‚Äôs not an overpowering scent and good for pretty much any occasion.

The dry down is soft and spicy with a hint of mandarin and citrus. The dry down is identical to the original and both have a synthetic smell to them. I like the original smell however I think Gucci tend to use cheaper smelling ingredients and this is a lot better value than the original.

The projection and sillage is great on this too, this leaves a strong trail for the first 30 minutes to an hour. Afterwards it becomes a fainter scent, sticking closer to the skin and lasts around 5 hours.

My mum was a fan of this one however her biggest flaw was the longevity and projection, but that was expected since the OG isn‚Äôt a great performer too.

\*\***Overall: 6.8/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Venom for women 0344 - Dior Poison**\*\*

Immediately you get a strong hit of plum and incense. The opening is very sweet, and I get some spicy notes too. There‚Äôs a slight petrol smell to this too, similar to Dior Fahrenheit, which is intoxicating and draws you in.

In the dry down it becomes a smokier scent with the vanilla, amber and sandalwood but keeps that seductive sweet smell from the opening. The dry down is identical to the original, it‚Äôs a classic DNA you can recognise straight away.

This projects and performs as well as the original. It lasts over 7 hours on my skin and you can smell it on clothes the next day too. The scent trail this leaves is exactly the same as the original. This is a very heavy fragrance so I would recommend this for evenings or colder weather.

My mum enjoyed PP‚Äôs interpretation of this however she didn‚Äôt like the opening, she found the initial opening, first 15 minutes or so, to be harsh on her nose.

\*\***Overall: 7/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Invisible for women 0135 - Ch\*nel Coco EDP**\*\*

In the opening of this I could smell peach, jasmine and rose as the main notes however I was also getting some sandalwood in the opening too which adds a layer of depth.

In the dry down I still mainly get sandalwood and rose but it‚Äôs a bit sweeter and more mellow with the vanilla and tonka bean. Comparing this directly to the original, this clone isn‚Äôt as strong and rich as the original however I prefer that. I find the original to be smothering and it makes me a bit nauseous however this PP clone is a toned-down version.

This fragrance is for my mum, and to her this smells identical to the original however to my nose this smells a lot more synthetic, which is expected.

Overall, the performance on this is close to the original in the sense that it projects for many hours and leaves a strong, recognisable, scent trail. The longevity is good too at around 7/8 hours on my skin.

Yet another great scent, my mum had the same comments as me on this; that it doesn‚Äôt have the same magic as the original but a good interpretation none the less.

\*\***Overall: 7.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Noire Poison for women 1137 - YSL Black Opium**\*\*

A very iconic smell which PP have nailed. A very sweet, almost boozy, opening with the pear and orange blossom. I can smell some praline and vanilla too which boost the sweet smell further.

The dry down is fruitier with the sharpness of the pink pepper and further on the coffee adds a gourmand almost chocolatey note. From opening to dry down this smells exactly the same as the original but perhaps doesn‚Äôt have the same clarity as the OG, by which I mean I can‚Äôt distinguish the notes as clearly as the OG but this clone still has that recognisable DNA and remains accurate throughout.

This projects like a beast and lasts over 8 hours on my skin. My mum had no complaints about this and was her second favourite out of the lot (TF Noir de Noir being first).

\*\***Overall: 7.8/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Repeat Purchases**\*\*

These are purchases I‚Äôve made in the past in with PP and decided to get another bottle of because I enjoyed them that much:

\*\***Only Man 0666 - D&amp;G The One**\*\*

This is my favourite PP scent and my go to for the evenings, I‚Äôve already reviewed this and had to get another bottle when my first one finished. This is very close to the original, but I‚Äôve found it lasts longer than the OG and being so cheap I can spray a lot of this too. I highly recommend everyone to try this especially if you‚Äôre a fan of the original!

\*\***Overall: 9/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Beyond 1702 - JPG Ultramale**\*\*

Another repeat purchase and this is also great however I‚Äôve found this a bit sickly. This has some of the strongest projection and longevity of any PP I‚Äôve tried and can be smelled easily the next day. Regardless this is a very close interpretation of the original and I would recommend this also.

\*\***Overall: 7.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Pioneer 0737 - MB Explorer**\*\*

Yet again another repurchase but this wasn‚Äôt for me but for my dad who absolutely abuses his fragrances and overspray‚Äôs than anyone I‚Äôve ever met. This is a clean inoffensive but generic fragrance and great for any situation. The performance and longevity are good, and this lasts all day but doesn‚Äôt develop much and stays the same throughout, which isn‚Äôt a bad thing but something to note.

\*\***Overall: 7.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Cyber Sports Extreme 0574 - Ch\*nel Allure Homme Sport EE**\*\*

This is my second bottle of PP CAHSEE, I grew to love this and actually prefer it to Navy Intense (BdC EDP). It opens with a very strong orange and remains very fresh and summery throughout with the mint. The tonka bean comes into play too in the dry down and adds much needed depth to this fragrance. My only gripe is that this smells a lot more synthetic than the original but of course that‚Äôs expected but on the other hand this has beast performance. This has excellent projection and lasts all day so be careful on the trigger.

\*\***Overall: 8.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Passion for men 0668 - Versace Eros**\*\*

Another repeat but again this is for my dad. A very known scent and I feel like there‚Äôs not much more to say except it‚Äôs fresh and minty. This PP clone is very close to the original and projects like a beast for hours!

\*\***Overall: 8/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Black Extreme 0645 - Tom Ford Noir de Noir**\*\*

This was for my mum and she‚Äôs a big fan of NdN. No joke every time we go out to see family or friends, she‚Äôs gotten compliments and is always asked what perfume she‚Äôs wearing, so much so my grandmother has asked me to get her a bottle of this too!

This is mature rose and chocolate scent which is unisex and performs like a beast, easily lasting over 24 hours on clothes and the projection is great too.

\*\***Overall: 8.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Others**:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Car Diffusers**:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Passion 0688 - Versace Eros**\*\*

The small glass bottles these came in are very nice and look great in my car, they come with an orange lace/string to hang with and wooden caps.

The smell is very close to the original Eros and I‚Äôve already reviewed the Passion clone above. The car diffusers slowly release the smell and with Passion (Eros) you mainly get the mint which you can smell as soon as you enter the car.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Exploding Blossom 0215 - V&amp;R Flowerbomb**\*\*

I‚Äôve not smelled the original however smelling the bottle, the name Flowerbomb completely fits. I get a lot of patchouli and jasmine.

This isn‚Äôt as strong as the Passion (Eros) car diffuser but does still give a very floral scent as soon as you enter the car. You get nose blind to these car diffusers quickly, but they are noticeable at first.

\*\***Wax Melts**:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Leaf Flavour 0401 - Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille**\*\*

For ¬£2.00 there were 7 little wax pieces and I wasn‚Äôt expecting much if I‚Äôm being honest since they‚Äôre quite small but wow was I blown away. The smell is beautiful, and one wax piece filled the whole bottom floor of my house for hours!

I much prefer Leaf Flavour (and TV) as a candle and a room scent rather than on me.

I‚Äôve used PP‚Äôs Golden Agar 0636 (Tom Ford Oud Wood) and this was very similar, from what I can remember. I would recommend this over the Oud Wood wax melts since it is almost half the price and smells just as warm and inviting.

I recommend adding some wax melts to your next order and for ¬£2.00 this is a no brainier!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Final Comments/TLDR**:\*\*

This is a collection of multiple orders bunched into one big post so if you made it to the end, I appreciate you taking the time!

Overall, I am happy with the purchases and tend to go off highly recommend PP clones or fragrances I really like to make an order. I‚Äôve found the performance and longevity on PP fragrances to improve over time, which is understandable since, I think, they‚Äôre blended as the orders come in.

This review took me over 2 months to write and I would really appreciate it if, you‚Äôre interested in making an order, to use my referral link. This \*\*isn‚Äôt\*\* a paid or sponsored post, I am a genuine fan of Perfume Parlour products and will be putting in another order for again another review.

Let me know your favourites to try for my next review! So far, my wish list is:

\*\***Immortal 1871 (Roja Dove - Elysium)**\*\*

\*\***Torn 1281 (Terre d‚ÄôHermes)**\*\*

\*\***Strong Pashtun 0031 (Black Afgano)**\*\*"

1619462124,Perfumes,Personal Perfume Nitpicks?,"I don't know if I'm the only one but I am very picky with the atomizer of the bottle. Of course the atomizer won't actually determine whether or not I'll get a perfume but it's definitely something I take note of. Best comparison is Tea Rose and my Incanto Amity bottles. One thing I love about the Amity bottle is that it sprays wonderfully, smooth long sprays making it easy to get a lot of product. Tea Rose on the other hand is the opposite; it's like when I press on the atomizer it just coughs out the product. The short sprays are irritating when Tea Rose isn't very strong on me so I need to spray more of the scent. 

What are your personal nitpicks you think only you have?"

1619717021,Perfumes,I'm escentually clueless when it comes to this. Hopeless husband that needs help.,"Hi everyone. I apologize for my absolute ignorance on this subject. I'm trying to find a good perfume for my wife. She's celebrating her first mother's Day and in addition to other gifts, I know this is something that she has wanted for some time. My question is this - my wife really likes a certain perfume that my sister-in-law has. It is called Chloe edp. She said that she would really love to have something like that, but she doesn't want the exact thing as she wants to have something different from her sister. I've tried to read up all on this topic, I've gone through these forums and looked at other websites as well, but what I keep seeing are answers about other perfumes that were made to smell like or ""dupe"" this one but are not exactly the same or are cheap smelling. I have no issue of price point, I want to get her something that she will really enjoy and enjoy wearing, but I just don't know what to be looking for. I want to find some examples of perfumes that may match the I guess general pallet of the one that she likes. I know she doesn't like really fruity things, or things that smell "" cheap "" or "" like something a high schooler would wear "". Admittedly I don't really know what this means, but I do see lots of mentions in other posts about things smelling cheap, or overly sweet, or like something that reminds them of when they were young. Again, I apologize for my absolute ignorance, as I don't wear cologne and have no experience in this area. I'm just hoping that someone out there can suggest a few different perfumes that may meet the criteria that she tends to enjoy - such as floral, complex, not very fruity, not with a heavy alcohol smell, something that a young adult woman would wear. Thank you all so much in advance for any advice. I truly appreciate it."

However recently I experimentally bought a new ‚Äúnatural‚Äù deodorant; I‚Äôve never smelled one like this and I am OBSESSED. It is the ‚ÄúBeach Rose and Aloe‚Äù scent from Raw Sugar. They don‚Äôt make anything else in this scent, but I would buy a perfume of this in a heartbeat. So I‚Äôm looking for recommendations for something close! It‚Äôs pretty descriptive - it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbeachy‚Äù (saltwater) rosey floral with just a slight hint of green and sweet. They are sold by Target if anyone is feeling adventurous enough to take a sniff. 

I‚Äôm a scent lover but until this year have mostly just done body sprays and lotions because I‚Äôm poor. I‚Äôm still poor, but recently decided finding a real perfume would be worth it since body sprays fade so quickly. So if possible, please keep recs in the 60 and under range (over is fine, but a ‚Äúthis is pricey‚Äù note would be helpful).  Thank you!"

It's been out of stock on amazon for years haha, so I have a couple questions:

1) Where can I buy the same exact perfume/scent again? If they're still selling it, it probably has a different look/packaging now which is fine. I just care about the actual scent itself lol.

2) Is the perfume linked above the same exact perfume as this?: 

https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/Issey-Miyake-Dete-Summer-Toilette/dp/B00U09YL3S?language=en_CA

That perfume on this second link shows up the most when I google ""Issey Miyake Eau de toilette pour l‚Äô√©t√© summer eau de toilette"", which are the words written on the original perfume that I bought lol. 

I don't know french at all but it seems like the words match so I was wondering if it's the same perfume."

**I was wondering if:**

1) Are they in fact from the same line of perfumes? I don't read french so idk haha, for all I know the words just translate to general ""summer perfume"" and not a specific name for a product line 

2) Are they the same exact scent, just released 5 years apart? 

3) I wanna buy the same exact perfume on the first link above, anyone know where I can buy it?

1621614022,Perfumes,Something similar to Mademoiselle Ricci,"Hi, everyone! First time posting here. I'm not a perfume enthusiast, but I need some help from those who are!

Some years ago I purchased an 80ml bottle of Mademoiselle Ricci, and I **loved it**. Now I'm finally reaching the end of the bottle (I don't wear perfume everyday) and I wanted to buy another one... But it's not available anywhere in my country!

Due to covid restrictions, it's hard for me to go out and just try every perfume available in the stores. So, I'd like to narrow my search a bit. I asked around and I got recommended Flower by Kenzo. I was told it was made by the same perfumer, Alberto Morillas, and that it's really similar. The reviews I looked for sounded great and just like what I want.

In short, I like sweet perfumes that are not too fruity, but more floral, and not sweetish, if you know what I mean (I'm sorry, English is not my first language).

Do you guys agree with Flower by Kenzo being a good option for me? Do you have any other recommendations? 

Thanks in advance, and have a great day!"

*Dior Homme Intense* EDP opens with a moderate to a solid projection of powdery and purple floral notes. The opening is bold, elegant, mature, unique, and intense.

The iris is your opening most notable note. Within this odor may be described as powdery, visionary, floral gender-neutral, smooth. With a touch of purple and suede floral touch.

The iris is the characteristic note and put alone on peak of the touch lineup. A measure behind is that the ambrette, also referred to as musk mallow, a somewhat sweet, yellow flowery, gentle, slightly musky, woody, and boozy accord.

The musky nuance of this ambrette functions as a mild sharpening and fostering accord, but it is not animalic or pungent.

The lavender has subdued participation behind the iris, but the considerably more powerful iris clouds it. The cherry shaped, vetiver, and cedar are service notes.

## Recommendation: Dior Homme Intense EDP is available discounted for approximately $90. It‚Äôs a perfect fragrance with fantastic functionality for older men that love iris fragrances. This is a superb purchase."

Now I'm hitting the end of my bottle of Norne and cannot find more.  I spent a good amount of time at an artisnal perfume company in SF yesterday, and came back with a few samples that stood out.

* Chris Collins, Danse Sauvage.  Cedarwood, cognac, a bit of vanilla!  Lighter and sweeter compared to Norne, but it smells nice and sticks around.  Lovely fresh cut wood scent.
* Rook Perfumes, Forest.  Incense, nom nom!  Lots of trees, pine and cedar, with a crushed ivy undernote.  This has the darker green resin quality I remember from Norne.
* Imaginary Authors, City On Fire.  Cardamom!  Smoke!  Labdanum.  Dark, smoky, sexy and dangerous.
* Chris Collins, Autumn Rhythm.  Another very green scent...like riding a motorcycle in a leather jacket through a redwood forest.
* Kerosene, Broken Theories.  Smoke, incense, oud.  A less potent blend of sensual dark notes than, say, City on Fire.

Forest is the closest I could find to Norne at this time."

1617349315,Perfumes,Perfume bottle design,"I was thinking about perfume bottle design and the trade off between originality and recognizability vs function. For example, there are some perfume bottles that are unique enough that they're pretty much instantly recognizable. In my opinion, examples include Carolina Herrera Good Girl, Ariana Grande Cloud Thank U Next or REM, Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy. There's a unique silhouette that makes it instantly recognizable. At a glance, people can say that the perfume shaped like a high heel is from the Good Girl line, or that the bottle with a bowtie and a giant crystal on the cap is one of the Viva La Juicy variants, or that the bottle with a cloud shaped base is Cloud. This helps a brand market their product as something more unique on the market. It's instantly recognizable as that brand and line. But on the flip side, I've heard from several people that they avoid buying these perfumes because of the unique bottle. People have said that the Good Girl high heel looks tacky, and I personally struggle with the sprayer on that one. Or that the Viva La Juicy bottles look very early 2000s kitsch and out of place on their perfume shelf. If you look at the regular bottles though, they are much more functional but I bet if I asked about a perfume with a rectangular bottle you could name at least 5 different brands that could be. These bottles include, in my opinion, things that while they have a consistent design thought that perfume line, are not unique enough that you can recognize it just from the silhouette. Stuff like Calvin Klein colognes, Maison Francis Kurkdijan perfumes, YSL Black Opium. For example, Chanel, Tom Ford, MFK, Gucci, and Burberry perfumes can be described as having square or rectangular bottles, very boxy with defined planes and edges. I'm not saying that every perfume from those brands fits that description, but a few sure do. The bottles are less recognizable based on their shape, but on the flip side you don't seem to have the problem of the bottle looking too put of place on your perfume shelf or any sprayer problems like with Good Girl. It's more functional than it is unique in shape. 

I want to hear other people's opinions or experiences with this, and whether they prefer a simple bottle that could be confused with a dozen others or a unique bottle that could have design flaws or look too out of place?"

Sorry to bother but I purchased ""Versace Eros"" almost two weeks from now. 
I am fascinated with the scent but it doesn't project good. Quite the opposite actually. When I applied it the first time, it projected pretty good(at least for me). Yesterday, I probably did more than 7 spraysüòÇ(I mostly do 4), and I could feel it only sometimes. If you are asking yourself is it fake, I bought it from Notino(it's my first buy).
Sorry because of my language skills in advance.
Thanks in advance"

1618422091,Perfumes,Finally Bought A Perfume I Considered for a Year!,"So I'm a huge fan of vintage everything so like-wise I'd like to have a collection of mainly vintage scents. I'm not ashamed of being stingy but it has held me back from enjoying the things I'd like to enjoy. 

After a year of eyeballing the Tabu by Dana at the Wal-mart I caved and bought it. I have the worst anxiety of regret purchasing so I regretted buying the perfume the second it scanned at the register but I didn't want to turn back lol 

Happy news is that I stopped regretting my purchase the second I actually smelled it! It's such a beautiful scent I'm definitely going to hit pan on this bottle and get a refill when I'm done. I heard it's got a bad rep because it's supposedly made for prostitutes but I don't care; if I smell like a Spanish Lady of the Night in the 30s I'm gonna be smelling like a Spanish Lady of the Night in the 30s!

1619433766,Perfumes,Perfume Parlour clone house review,"This post is strictly my opinion and I have paid for all these fragrances out of my own pockets. I only order the sprays, unless I‚Äôve stated otherwise, as I find them to be the easiest to use and they perform more like the original than the oils. When I first get an order in, I leave the fragrances in the fridge for two weeks to macerate before I review them or wear them properly.

&amp;#x200B;

This order was a mixed bag of new fragrances, repeat purchases which I‚Äôve re-reviewed, car diffusers and wax melts.

These reviews take a lot of time and effort to write up, if you would like to order from PP, I would appreciate it if you signed up with my link below. You get \*\*10% off\*\* and I get a little kickback also:

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Avalanche Woody 1848 - Creed Aventus\***\*

This was a new purchase and a blind buy for me as I haven‚Äôt smelled the original Aventus before, I decided to get the 60ml ‚Äúextract‚Äù bottle and the presentation and bottle itself is really nice and much better than the 13/30/50ml variants the sprayer is also heavier weighted and as a whole feels of much better quality.

The smell is very fresh, and I get bergamot the most on the opening. Unlike the name suggests I don‚Äôt get a very woody smell but there is a hint of pencil shavings as the fragrance develops and sets on your skin. This has some depth and develops the more you wear it and is definitely one of my favourites from PP.

The longevity and projection is great too and this lasts me all day and has got me multiple compliments and I will for sure be getting another bottle of this when mine runs out!

\*\***Overall: 9/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Agar Gold (Stronger Version) 0038 - Tom Ford Oud Wood**\*\*

A very spicy yet still fresh fragrance. This smells quite close to the original, but I feel like it has something missing and I can‚Äôt quite put my nose on it. The opening has a strong opening of cardamom and I get a very powdery smell from it.

The warmth of the vanilla and tonka bean come through in the dry down. The dry down is a lot closer to the original and both have that mass appealing warmth which I enjoy so much about Oud Wood. This will be great for evening and cooler days Autumn days.

The biggest downside with this clone is that the projection is good for about 30/45 minutes but dies down quite quickly and it becomes a skin scent around the 1 hour 30 minutes. This the worst performance of the bunch and although this is the ‚Äústronger version‚Äù it‚Äôs a terrible performer.

\*\***Overall: 7.4/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Bean Tasty 1604 - Dior Feve Delicieuse**\*\*

My first impressions was that this smells like Play-Doh. The lavender is very prominent in the opening and I get a little mint after about 5 minutes.

The dry down is very milky, nutty, and sweet yet isn‚Äôt feminine leaning as I thought. I get tonka bean and vanilla a lot too and I can smell some iris although it‚Äôs not listed in the notes. The dry down reminds me very much of Dior Homme Intense which is strange since their only mutual note is lavender.

I haven‚Äôt had a chance to smell the original, but I‚Äôve seen and read reviews that say this is a pretty accurate interpretation of the OG but of course doesn‚Äôt come up to par with quality and blending of the Dior private line.

The performance is okay, and the projection is decent too, but this doesn‚Äôt leave a strong scent trail. It more-so lingers on your skin. The longevity is okay too at about 4 hours ish on my skin, but I‚Äôve noticed with all PP clones they do get better with performance and longevity with time.

\*\***Overall: 7.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Card Red 1681 - MFK Baccarat Rouge 540**\*\*

In the initial spray I could smell minty cotton candy. This is a sweet fragrance but is also quite fresh. The opening is harsher and not as well blended as the original, but it still has that famous BR540 DNA and you can tell what it‚Äôs ‚Äúinspired‚Äù from.

The freshness stays throughout, and the mint smell reminds me off Mr Burberry Indigo. I know that mint isn‚Äôt a listed note in the original, but I know many people say they can smell it. Card red remains a thick and creamy scent throughout and this smells a lot more expensive than it is.

A very unisex scent which I think is suitable for any occasion or weather however I can see this excelling in the colder seasons for sure. I have smelled the original numerous times, and this is a very close clone throughout. Since the original is completely synthetic, I imagine it‚Äôs quite an easy fragrance to clone. My only gripe is that this doesn‚Äôt have that depth of BR540 but at a fraction of the price it‚Äôs a great purchase and I can‚Äôt complain.

The performance was okay on this, I was underwhelmed to be honest since the original lasts well over 8 hours on my skin. This projected well for the first hour or two but then became a skin scent and I stayed getting whiffs of it on my arm for 6 hours ish.

\*\***Overall: 8.4/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Exploding Aroma for men 0559 - V&amp;R Spicebomb**\*\*

A fresh opening with the clean bergamot and grapefruit this opens fresher than the original but is still a pleasant smell from the get-go.

In the dry down I continue to get bergamot but now with a little bit of saffron and pink pepper. I also get cardamom and some spicier notes, but it still remains fresh and doesn‚Äôt develop much further into the heavier tobacco and leather notes.

I‚Äôd say this is one of the worst PP clones I‚Äôve smelled. The original is a lot warmer and had a much stronger cinnamon note and was spicier and a more inviting. I‚Äôm going to let this macerate more and I hope it improves however so far, it‚Äôs the least accurate interpretation I‚Äôve smelled from them yet.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me, but I go nose-blind to this very quickly and projection and longevity on this is amongst the worse, I can‚Äôt smell it on my skin after 2 hours.

\*\***Overall: 4/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Leaf Flavour 0401 - Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille**\*\*

Straight away I get a heavy hit of tobacco and spices, I can smell clove specifically. This is very strong, and the smell almost punched me when I put my nose to it. Truthfully, I‚Äôm not a big fan of the original so I‚Äôm not surprised I wasn‚Äôt a fan of this however this does smell very close to the original TV.

The vanilla is mellow and helps balance the spicy tobacco notes in the opening. I also get some agar wood in the dry down which also helps the fragrance last longer and have that strong almost musky smell. In the dry down this smells identical to the original and I was smelling them side by side. By the 6/7 hour mark I was only getting vanilla.

This is one of the most accurate PP clones I‚Äôve smelled, and I can understand the praise this has. I would recommend this more to an older audience and it is masculine leaning however both men and women could pull this off. I like this a lot more as a candle/wax melt (see below). This fragrance doesn‚Äôt suit my personality or style so I won‚Äôt be getting another bottle but, in the future, I think a more mature me will appreciate this.

The performance on this is amazing. This lasted over 24 hours on my clothes and projects for well over 6 hours on my skin.

\*\***Overall: 5/10 (very good clone I‚Äôm just not a fan of the fragrance itself)**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Sweet Water for men 1262 - AdG Profumo**\*\*

A very fresh and oceanic seawater and sunlight fragrance. This PP clone is very close to the original with a bright and balanced opening. The freshness of the original isn‚Äôt fully there but it is close enough and for the price does a great job.

After 15-20 minutes once the top notes die down it smells almost identical to the original with the sage and rosemary. Where they differ is that I get more patchouli in the PP whereas the original Profumo is smokier with more incense.

The projection on this is okay and it projects well on my skin, but the longevity is terrible and doesn‚Äôt last as long as the original. But, again as with the Oud Wood clone since it‚Äôs so much cheaper than the OG you can go a bit heavier on the sprayer. I was getting decent projection for the first 30 minutes but after that you really struggle to smell this unless your bury your nose into your skin.

\*\***Overall: 7.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Sweet Milan for men 1418 - Armani Code Profumo**\*\*

A sweet yet fresh scent with an initial burst of apple and mandarin. The green apple is very realistic smelling and almost reminds me the mint and pear in Ultra Male. The cardamom is there too but it‚Äôs very faint and if I didn‚Äôt know the note breakdown, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to recognise it.

In the dry down I mainly smell amber and faint whiffs of lavender and the orange blossom. In the dry down this remains fresh and sweet but doesn‚Äôt develop much further. This nails the Code DNA and smells very similar to the original Code Profumo after 30 minutes.

The performance is good and projects well for the first 30 minutes to an hour but after that this became a skin scent on me, and I could smell it faintly after 4 hours. The original is stronger throughout and lasts longer on me too.

\*\***Overall: 8.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***NB: I don‚Äôt have, nor have smelled, the originals of the following three fragrances. These were free samples included in my order which I chose randomly. These aren‚Äôt fragrances I‚Äôd ever pick myself, so I thought to try something out of my comfort zone.**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Leaf Citrus 1814 - Byredo Tobacco Mandarin**\*\*

In the initial spray I get the spicy and fresh notes of the coriander and cumin with a background of mandarin. This is a very smothering and heavy fragrance with an air of freshness to it.

In the dry down I get a lot of sandalwood and Tobacco with a bit of leather, I don‚Äôt have the original to compare so I can‚Äôt comment on how close it is. This fragrance keeps the mandarin at the front and makes me think of walking through a mandarin field in a wet and humid climate. It has an earthy smell in it too from the coriander and cumin. This is very different from anything else I‚Äôve smelled and definitely not your average designer fragrance.

I don‚Äôt like nor dislike this fragrance, it‚Äôs nice in the dry down but very pungent and polarising in the opening.

In the first 30 minutes this projects very well but quickly dries down to become a skin scent. At the 1 hour 30 mark I can only smell sandalwood and faint mandarin. But it continues to linger close to my skin throughout the day but loses projection.

\*\***Overall: 6.2/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Venice 1788 - Tiziana Terenzi Casanova**\*\*

In the opening I straight away get a blast of bergamot and jasmine with powdery notes which give it a make-up type smell too. This shocked me as from the nozzle this smelled like a McDonalds Fish Fillet but spraying it on my arm I was pleasantly surprised with a fresh and flowery smell.

In the dry down I continue to get bergamot and jasmine but now with sweetness and rose of the pink pepper. This, alongside the vanilla, is definitely the best part of the perfume and makes wearing it very enjoyable. Further into the dry down I get more amber and tonka bean, and I can smell some sandalwood too although that‚Äôs not in the note breakdown, which adds some needed depth to this fragrance. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have the original to compare this so I can‚Äôt comment on how accurate this is but from reading reviews of the OG online I feel like this is a good comparison.

Although I am a fan of this, I won‚Äôt be getting a bottle for myself as it is quite feminine leaning. A great scent none the less!

The projection on this was excellent and left a strong scent trail throughout the day.

\*\***Overall: 7.3/10\***\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Glazy Flower 1805 - Killian Roses on Ice**\*\*

This has one of the nicest openings I‚Äôve smelled, it‚Äôs a very balanced and fresh opening with a cocktail of cucumber, lime, and juniper berries. The juniper berries remind me a lot of YSL Y EDP, which is my favourite fragrance and give the fragrance a very mass-appealing blue smell.

Unfortunately, this is another one I don‚Äôt have a sample to compare to so I cannot comment on how accurate it is.

The dry down keeps the fresh aquatic smell but adds some rose and sandalwood. The rose is very faint, and I get slight whiffs of it as well as faint smells of gin. Unlike other rose scents this isn‚Äôt heavy or leathery and sweet but fresh, clean and this smells very designer. This is a unisex fragrance and I think it‚Äôll be greatly suited for a very hot summer day.

This is quite a generic scent and has an oceanic and aquatic smell to it - similar to Acqua Di Gio. I find it really pleasant however I understand this is quite different to what By Killian normally do.

The performance is good but not great. The projection is good for the hour, but this quickly fades after. This still leaves a great scent trail for about 4 hours and I can still smell it faintly on myself around the 6-hour mark.

Out of these three fragrances I‚Äôve tried, I think I‚Äôll be adding this to my list and be getting a 30ml bottle in my next order!

\*\***Overall: 8.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Women‚Äôs fragrances**:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

All these below were purchased for my mum for her to wear to work, she has the originals of all of these, so I was able to directly compare them. I tried these all myself so bear in mind these are my opinions and I know I‚Äôm not the target audience for these fragrances.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Florence Notorious II for women 0234 - Gucci Guilty for her**\*\*

Straight away in the opening I get a floral lilac and patchouli scent. It‚Äôs very close to the original in the opening and has that soapy and almost make up type smell to it - very feminine and powdery. It‚Äôs not an overpowering scent and good for pretty much any occasion.

The dry down is soft and spicy with a hint of mandarin and citrus. The dry down is identical to the original and both have a synthetic smell to them. I like the original smell however I think Gucci tend to use cheaper smelling ingredients and this is a lot better value than the original.

The projection and sillage is great on this too, this leaves a strong trail for the first 30 minutes to an hour. Afterwards it becomes a fainter scent, sticking closer to the skin and lasts around 5 hours.

My mum was a fan of this one however her biggest flaw was the longevity and projection, but that was expected since the OG isn‚Äôt a great performer too.

\*\***Overall: 6.8/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Venom for women 0344 - Dior Poison**\*\*

Immediately you get a strong hit of plum and incense. The opening is very sweet, and I get some spicy notes too. There‚Äôs a slight petrol smell to this too, similar to Dior Fahrenheit, which is intoxicating and draws you in.

In the dry down it becomes a smokier scent with the vanilla, amber and sandalwood but keeps that seductive sweet smell from the opening. The dry down is identical to the original, it‚Äôs a classic DNA you can recognise straight away.

This projects and performs as well as the original. It lasts over 7 hours on my skin and you can smell it on clothes the next day too. The scent trail this leaves is exactly the same as the original. This is a very heavy fragrance so I would recommend this for evenings or colder weather.

My mum enjoyed PP‚Äôs interpretation of this however she didn‚Äôt like the opening, she found the initial opening, first 15 minutes or so, to be harsh on her nose.

\*\***Overall: 7/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Invisible for women 0135 - Ch\*nel Coco EDP**\*\*

In the opening of this I could smell peach, jasmine and rose as the main notes however I was also getting some sandalwood in the opening too which adds a layer of depth.

In the dry down I still mainly get sandalwood and rose but it‚Äôs a bit sweeter and more mellow with the vanilla and tonka bean. Comparing this directly to the original, this clone isn‚Äôt as strong and rich as the original however I prefer that. I find the original to be smothering and it makes me a bit nauseous however this PP clone is a toned-down version.

This fragrance is for my mum, and to her this smells identical to the original however to my nose this smells a lot more synthetic, which is expected.

Overall, the performance on this is close to the original in the sense that it projects for many hours and leaves a strong, recognisable, scent trail. The longevity is good too at around 7/8 hours on my skin.

Yet another great scent, my mum had the same comments as me on this; that it doesn‚Äôt have the same magic as the original but a good interpretation none the less.

\*\***Overall: 7.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Noire Poison for women 1137 - YSL Black Opium**\*\*

A very iconic smell which PP have nailed. A very sweet, almost boozy, opening with the pear and orange blossom. I can smell some praline and vanilla too which boost the sweet smell further.

The dry down is fruitier with the sharpness of the pink pepper and further on the coffee adds a gourmand almost chocolatey note. From opening to dry down this smells exactly the same as the original but perhaps doesn‚Äôt have the same clarity as the OG, by which I mean I can‚Äôt distinguish the notes as clearly as the OG but this clone still has that recognisable DNA and remains accurate throughout.

This projects like a beast and lasts over 8 hours on my skin. My mum had no complaints about this and was her second favourite out of the lot (TF Noir de Noir being first).

\*\***Overall: 7.8/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Repeat Purchases**\*\*

These are purchases I‚Äôve made in the past in with PP and decided to get another bottle of because I enjoyed them that much:

\*\***Only Man 0666 - D&amp;G The One**\*\*

This is my favourite PP scent and my go to for the evenings, I‚Äôve already reviewed this and had to get another bottle when my first one finished. This is very close to the original, but I‚Äôve found it lasts longer than the OG and being so cheap I can spray a lot of this too. I highly recommend everyone to try this especially if you‚Äôre a fan of the original!

\*\***Overall: 9/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Beyond 1702 - JPG Ultramale**\*\*

Another repeat purchase and this is also great however I‚Äôve found this a bit sickly. This has some of the strongest projection and longevity of any PP I‚Äôve tried and can be smelled easily the next day. Regardless this is a very close interpretation of the original and I would recommend this also.

\*\***Overall: 7.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Pioneer 0737 - MB Explorer**\*\*

Yet again another repurchase but this wasn‚Äôt for me but for my dad who absolutely abuses his fragrances and overspray‚Äôs than anyone I‚Äôve ever met. This is a clean inoffensive but generic fragrance and great for any situation. The performance and longevity are good, and this lasts all day but doesn‚Äôt develop much and stays the same throughout, which isn‚Äôt a bad thing but something to note.

\*\***Overall: 7.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Cyber Sports Extreme 0574 - Ch\*nel Allure Homme Sport EE**\*\*

This is my second bottle of PP CAHSEE, I grew to love this and actually prefer it to Navy Intense (BdC EDP). It opens with a very strong orange and remains very fresh and summery throughout with the mint. The tonka bean comes into play too in the dry down and adds much needed depth to this fragrance. My only gripe is that this smells a lot more synthetic than the original but of course that‚Äôs expected but on the other hand this has beast performance. This has excellent projection and lasts all day so be careful on the trigger.

\*\***Overall: 8.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Passion for men 0668 - Versace Eros**\*\*

Another repeat but again this is for my dad. A very known scent and I feel like there‚Äôs not much more to say except it‚Äôs fresh and minty. This PP clone is very close to the original and projects like a beast for hours!

\*\***Overall: 8/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Black Extreme 0645 - Tom Ford Noir de Noir**\*\*

This was for my mum and she‚Äôs a big fan of NdN. No joke every time we go out to see family or friends, she‚Äôs gotten compliments and is always asked what perfume she‚Äôs wearing, so much so my grandmother has asked me to get her a bottle of this too!

This is mature rose and chocolate scent which is unisex and performs like a beast, easily lasting over 24 hours on clothes and the projection is great too.

\*\***Overall: 8.5/10**\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Others**:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Car Diffusers**:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Passion 0688 - Versace Eros**\*\*

The small glass bottles these came in are very nice and look great in my car, they come with an orange lace/string to hang with and wooden caps.

The smell is very close to the original Eros and I‚Äôve already reviewed the Passion clone above. The car diffusers slowly release the smell and with Passion (Eros) you mainly get the mint which you can smell as soon as you enter the car.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Exploding Blossom 0215 - V&amp;R Flowerbomb**\*\*

I‚Äôve not smelled the original however smelling the bottle, the name Flowerbomb completely fits. I get a lot of patchouli and jasmine.

This isn‚Äôt as strong as the Passion (Eros) car diffuser but does still give a very floral scent as soon as you enter the car. You get nose blind to these car diffusers quickly, but they are noticeable at first.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Wax Melts**:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Leaf Flavour 0401 - Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille**\*\*

For ¬£2.00 there were 7 little wax pieces and I wasn‚Äôt expecting much if I‚Äôm being honest since they‚Äôre quite small but wow was I blown away. The smell is beautiful, and one wax piece filled the whole bottom floor of my house for hours!

I much prefer Leaf Flavour (and TV) as a candle and a room scent rather than on me.

I‚Äôve used PP‚Äôs Golden Agar 0636 (Tom Ford Oud Wood) and this was very similar, from what I can remember. I would recommend this over the Oud Wood wax melts since it is almost half the price and smells just as warm and inviting.

I recommend adding some wax melts to your next order and for ¬£2.00 this is a no brainier!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***Final Comments/TLDR**:\*\*

This is a collection of multiple orders bunched into one big post so if you made it to the end, I appreciate you taking the time!

Overall, I am happy with the purchases and tend to go off highly recommend PP clones or fragrances I really like to make an order. I‚Äôve found the performance and longevity on PP fragrances to improve over time, which is understandable since, I think, they‚Äôre blended as the orders come in.

This review took me over 2 months to write and I would really appreciate it if, you‚Äôre interested in making an order, to use my referral link. This \*\*isn‚Äôt\*\* a paid or sponsored post, I am a genuine fan of Perfume Parlour products and will be putting in another order for again another review.

Let me know your favourites to try for my next review! So far, my wish list is:

\*\***Immortal 1871 (Roja Dove - Elysium)**\*\*

\*\***Torn 1281 (Terre d‚ÄôHermes)**\*\*

\*\***Strong Pashtun 0031 (Black Afgano)**\*\*"

1619462124,Perfumes,Personal Perfume Nitpicks?,"I don't know if I'm the only one but I am very picky with the atomizer of the bottle. Of course the atomizer won't actually determine whether or not I'll get a perfume but it's definitely something I take note of. Best comparison is Tea Rose and my Incanto Amity bottles. One thing I love about the Amity bottle is that it sprays wonderfully, smooth long sprays making it easy to get a lot of product. Tea Rose on the other hand is the opposite; it's like when I press on the atomizer it just coughs out the product. The short sprays are irritating when Tea Rose isn't very strong on me so I need to spray more of the scent. 

What are your personal nitpicks you think only you have?"

1619717021,Perfumes,I'm escentually clueless when it comes to this. Hopeless husband that needs help.,"Hi everyone. I apologize for my absolute ignorance on this subject. I'm trying to find a good perfume for my wife. She's celebrating her first mother's Day and in addition to other gifts, I know this is something that she has wanted for some time. My question is this - my wife really likes a certain perfume that my sister-in-law has. It is called Chloe edp. She said that she would really love to have something like that, but she doesn't want the exact thing as she wants to have something different from her sister. I've tried to read up all on this topic, I've gone through these forums and looked at other websites as well, but what I keep seeing are answers about other perfumes that were made to smell like or ""dupe"" this one but are not exactly the same or are cheap smelling. I have no issue of price point, I want to get her something that she will really enjoy and enjoy wearing, but I just don't know what to be looking for. I want to find some examples of perfumes that may match the I guess general pallet of the one that she likes. I know she doesn't like really fruity things, or things that smell "" cheap "" or "" like something a high schooler would wear "". Admittedly I don't really know what this means, but I do see lots of mentions in other posts about things smelling cheap, or overly sweet, or like something that reminds them of when they were young. Again, I apologize for my absolute ignorance, as I don't wear cologne and have no experience in this area. I'm just hoping that someone out there can suggest a few different perfumes that may meet the criteria that she tends to enjoy - such as floral, complex, not very fruity, not with a heavy alcohol smell, something that a young adult woman would wear. Thank you all so much in advance for any advice. I truly appreciate it."

However recently I experimentally bought a new ‚Äúnatural‚Äù deodorant; I‚Äôve never smelled one like this and I am OBSESSED. It is the ‚ÄúBeach Rose and Aloe‚Äù scent from Raw Sugar.

2) Is the perfume linked above the same exact perfume as this?: 

https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/Issey-Miyake-Dete-Summer-Toilette/dp/B00U09YL3S?language=en_CA

That perfume on this second link shows up the most when I google ""Issey Miyake Eau de toilette pour l‚Äô√©t√© summer eau de toilette"", which are the words written on the original perfume that I bought lol. 

I don't know french at all but it seems like the words match so I was wondering if it's the same perfume."

That's the 2010 version according to the product details.

Now I came across this one as well, which i THINK is the same perfume(?): **https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/Issey-Miyake-Dete-Summer-Toilette/dp/B00U09YL3S?language=en_CA**

That's the 2015 version according to the product details.

I also came across this one: **https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Issey-Miyake/L-Eau-d-Issey-Pour-Homme-Summer-2018-49204.html**

That's the 2018 version according to the product details.

**I was wondering if:**

1) Are they in fact from the same line of perfumes? I don't read french so idk haha, for all I know the words just translate to general ""summer perfume"" and not a specific name for a product line 

2) Are they the same exact scent, just released 5 years apart? 

3) I wanna buy the same exact perfume on the first link above, anyone know where I can buy it? It's been out of stock on amazon for years, and even the newer 2015 version is out of stock lol so I was wondering if anyone knows where to buy it. Don't care if it's a newer packaging, I just want to buy the actual scent lol"

I understand why people feel it works better as a room spray or something, however on my skin its delicately sweet with a little something extra

Narciso Rodriguez Pure Musc: I personally don't like any of the NR perfumes I'm about to review lol but this one does not read as musk to me. It just smells like a powdery grandma.

NR for her: this smells like coco chanel but with a lot of rose, which to me is extremely unpleasant because I despise the smell of roses lol

NR fluer Musc: this perfume also smells quite powdery and reminds me of marc jacobs daisy perfume but a little bit brighter and less offensive (again, not a fan of florals but this one is ok. It might be nice in the summer time!) 

Aerin Amber Musk: this initially smells very warm and simple (meaning not a ton of notes going on, just a pleasant amber scent) but then as it dries down and wears it just smells like a powdery grandmother üôÉ

MJ Eau So Decadent- it‚Äôs such a unique scent to me and there isn‚Äôt anything like it in my collection except for the OG Decadence (although they aren‚Äôt *that* alike). Plus, the packaging is so cute, I love it truly. When I tried the sample, it lasted really long on my skin as well. 

Chanel Chance Eau Fraiche- majority of my collection leans more on fresh, citrusy scents so this is right up my alley and I just know I need this in my collection. Fell in love with it on the first spray. I already have the OG Chance EDT and EDP which I also love. Eau Fraiche is a more unisex citrus which I also don‚Äôt have in my collection yet because most of my citruses are sweet and floral. This doesn‚Äôt last too long on my though.

Please let me know your thoughts! I know they‚Äôre totally on different sides of the fragrance spectrum but which one do you like better?

Im looking for a scent that is close to the skin, fresh and not too heavy, wearable throughout the year. Im open to layering, but dont want a huge projection.

I cannot wear any fragrances with amber, as my skin amplifies it too much, in general my skin tends to bring out heavy notes and weights the scent down. I would appreciate something that has a light to medium projection and smells fresh yet warm and cozy. Im not too fond of powdery notes.

Again thanks so much for any suggestions :)"

1617349315,Perfumes,Perfume bottle design,"I was thinking about perfume bottle design and the trade off between originality and recognizability vs function. For example, there are some perfume bottles that are unique enough that they're pretty much instantly recognizable. In my opinion, examples include Carolina Herrera Good Girl, Ariana Grande Cloud Thank U Next or REM, Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy. There's a unique silhouette that makes it instantly recognizable. At a glance, people can say that the perfume shaped like a high heel is from the Good Girl line, or that the bottle with a bowtie and a giant crystal on the cap is one of the Viva La Juicy variants, or that the bottle with a cloud shaped base is Cloud. This helps a brand market their product as something more unique on the market. It's instantly recognizable as that brand and line. But on the flip side, I've heard from several people that they avoid buying these perfumes because of the unique bottle. People have said that the Good Girl high heel looks tacky, and I personally struggle with the sprayer on that one. Or that the Viva La Juicy bottles look very early 2000s kitsch and out of place on their perfume shelf. If you look at the regular bottles though, they are much more functional but I bet if I asked about a perfume with a rectangular bottle you could name at least 5 different brands that could be. These bottles include, in my opinion, things that while they have a consistent design thought that perfume line, are not unique enough that you can recognize it just from the silhouette. Stuff like Calvin Klein colognes, Maison Francis Kurkdijan perfumes, YSL Black Opium. For example, Chanel, Tom Ford, MFK, Gucci, and Burberry perfumes can be described as having square or rectangular bottles, very boxy with defined planes and edges. I'm not saying that every perfume from those brands fits that description, but a few sure do. The bottles are less recognizable based on their shape, but on the flip side you don't seem to have the problem of the bottle looking too put of place on your perfume shelf or any sprayer problems like with Good Girl. It's more functional than it is unique in shape. 

I want to hear other people's opinions or experiences with this, and whether they prefer a simple bottle that could be confused with a dozen others or a unique bottle that could have design flaws or look too out of place?"

After a year of eyeballing the Tabu by Dana at the Wal-mart I caved and bought it. I have the worst anxiety of regret purchasing so I regretted buying the perfume the second it scanned at the register but I didn't want to turn back lol 

Happy news is that I stopped regretting my purchase the second I actually smelled it! It's such a beautiful scent I'm definitely going to hit pan on this bottle and get a refill when I'm done. I heard it's got a bad rep because it's supposedly made for prostitutes but I don't care; if I smell like a Spanish Lady of the Night in the 30s I'm gonna be smelling like a Spanish Lady of the Night in the 30s!

1609611238,Perfumes,Would love to hear about the wallflowers of your collections...,"Hello all, first time posting here! I‚Äôd love to start a conversation about the (according to your own nose of course) unremarkable fragrances in your collection. The ones that (your nose) finds to be rather blah or just meh. But you still can‚Äôt help loving and wearing them. They don‚Äôt scream for attention and might be terribly safe or mainstream but still your love persists.

It‚Äôs not about what others find to be blah or meh, it has to be a scent that you find unremarkable, but you love it. Oooh the irony of it all!

For example, mine would be Aquolina Pink Sugar. It‚Äôs sweet, it‚Äôs cotton candy, and that‚Äôs about all I can say. Meh. But I was 23 when it came out and all my friends and I were in love. I think it remains in constant rotation for nearly 20 years for that reason alone. Perhaps nothing special to my nose, but she‚Äôs got my loyalty!

And yours?"

1609649986,Perfumes,Recommendations please,"I'm a woman in her mid 30s and I think it's time for me to have a signature scent.

When I was younger, my go to's were D&amp;G Light Blue, Paris Hilton, Versace Bright Crystal, Escada Rockin Rio, and Philosophy Amazing Grace. Mostly light and sweet/fruity/floral scents, in my opinion.

I've been using Romance by Ralph Lauren and Rose Jam from Lush. Though they smell nice, I'm not 100% sure if I'd like to stick to any of them.

I recently bought Philosophy Amazing Grace again because of nostalgia (and because it was on sale) but I don't know, I guess I don't like the scent as much anymore.

Maybe my preference has changed so I tried to go for something more mature and warm. I sampled Angel by Thierry Mugler and Tom Ford Fucking Fabulous, but ended up not liking both of them. To me, they smell sweet but very musky -- kinda reminds me of my grandma's scent. 

So now I'm quite confused, I don't know what I should try next. Any recommendations please? Thanks!"

‚ÄúDid you just do laundry today? You smell like clean laundry; like laundry detergent...‚Äù

Why??? Was my mistake putting on perfume and then getting dressed?? Should I start looking for a new combination? Because I do not spend over 100‚Ç¨ in smells to be outshined by fucking detergent. Or should I wash my clothes with some perfume or something? I had washed my clothes like a week prior I just keep them all folded with more clean clothes so may be the smell remained?

I‚Äôve been wearing cologne/fragrance for a few years now, I‚Äôm a 20 year old guy, I‚Äôm not any sort of big clubber/ f boy/ etc although I love getting extremely over the top every once in a while, apart from that I‚Äôm chill, relax and have a chat sort of person, maybe my fragrance choices below will help as well?

I‚Äôve been wearing CH Priv√© for a couple years, probably my #1, I recently (read today xD) bought the sauvage EDP which I love (I really like the parfum but doesn‚Äôt project as well/ last as long).

For my fresher scents I‚Äôve got Jean Paul Gautier le male, which I like but I do find disappears quick, and Pierre Cardin pour homme (cheap and only lasts 30 minutes).

When thinking of suggestions, I like the smell of one million for example, but would NEVER EVER wear it. I also recently smelt terre d‚Äôhermes which I like, but it smell a bit like millipedes to me ( I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up with my brain)

So I‚Äôm looking for ideas for something long lasting, yet nothing like what I have, something that could be worn anywhere, but I‚Äôm open to more specific smells if they‚Äôre good enough.

Any compliment grabbers are appreciated, but not so common you smell them everywhere you go.

Budget isn‚Äôt a problem, I don‚Äôt mind spending the money if it‚Äôs worth it

Thanks for your ideas!

The closest I've come upon is a seller on Etsy who sells an oil by the name Cleopatra, but does not list any of the fragrant notes in the oil. I tried to reach out to then to ask specifics on the scent, but no response. So I'm surprised there haven't been any sellers who have duped this fragrance.

So today I have a big announcement to make!

# Cheaper Shipping Price Available now

After a long battle with Post-Serbia, I can proudly say that today we have better shipping prices!

Here are new shipping prices:

[https://imgur.com/a/HUhU1qq](https://imgur.com/a/HUhU1qq)

It's a big price difference, I am really glad we succeeded to get prices like this.

Since it's now by grams, here is an example of how much does each bottle weighs.

[https://imgur.com/a/E9vmXEb](https://imgur.com/a/E9vmXEb)

We added a weight calculator on checkout so you can see how much does your package weighs and it will automatically update the shipping price.

So now for example, if you want to buy 5x20ml, the weight will be 165g +80g from box = 245g (125-250g price)

That's almost twice as cheaper as the previous price was.

# New Arrivals

We also added 3 new perfumes

Inspired by:

Montale Intense Cafe - Coffee Dream

Dior J'adiore - Bredore

Jean-Paul Gaultier Scandal - Drama Queen

They are available now on the website

# Maldives

I'll be traveling to the Maldives on 17th February. If any RepFam is in the Maldives on that period, please hit me before that date and I'll bring you some perfume to try out and chill.

Again thank you very much for the support, and if you need any help, please let me know and I will be happy to help,

Much Love,

1610510103,Perfumes,20 yo looking for a signature scent!,"Hello everyone,

I hope to get some help from you guys!¬†I am recently wanting to switch up the perfume I have been using -- don't get me wrong I still like that scent a lot but I feel like it suits me better in the summer and it's a bit too sweet for my age (college student, one year till graduation). However, I am overwhelmed by all the options because I don't know a lot about perfumes. Given it is COVID now, I also have very limited opportunities to go to the store and smell each scent in person. I am wondering if anyone can suggest some perfumes that check the boxes of what I am looking for!

Perfume I used before (since high school):¬†A'PIEU My Handy Roll-On in Peach

Perfume I am looking for:

\- better suits in fall and winter ( I live in Vancouver so the weather is cold and rainy)

\- not too mature for a 20 yo (but not overly sweet as well because I look way younger than 20)

\- contains notes of vanilla and caramel? (I don't like floral smells)

\- gives a clean but warm and cozy feeling

\- affordable¬†but preferably not too common (I once saved up to¬†get a Chloe roller but turns out a lot of my friends are using that...)

I actually have one in mind -- MAC Creme d'nude, and I went to the store to smell it recently. I smell nothing besides the alcohol in the first 10 minutes, but it smells good later when I got home. My mum said it does not suit me because it smells a bit dirty... if that makes sense? Creme d'nude checked all my boxes (vanilla and caramel are actually on the list because of this)¬†but I am hesitating because impressions are a huge factor in determining if a perfume suits me!

Sorry for the long passage and I hope someone can help me out! Thank you in advance:)"

1610720282,Perfumes,Narciso Poudr√©e for my little sister ?,"Hello ! (:

I would like to offer a perfume to my little sister for her 30th birthday.

Do you think Narciso Poudr√©e by Narciso Rodriguez 
may be suitable for a rather introverted young woman, who doesn't want to disturb, gentle, dreamy, romantic, quite innocent, peaceful,  a little fragile, who you want to protect? Who likes to prepare herself without overdoing it? (Never too sophisticated make-up, for example. Not the type to comb her hair for hours either).
Her companion says she's a little fairy, and it's true, she has that aura.
She's INFP enneagram 9, if you are familiar with it.

She likes to wear a cute  little dress with boots, or a blazer with collar. She loves hats, too.

This perfume is not too ""ladylike"" assertive? It's rather versatile and goes everywhere, doesn't it? Simple, soft, elegant and not disturbing?

She knows Narciso Rodriguez For Her EDT (the black bottle)but finds a too strong note in it as soon as it is sprayed, probably the omansthus.

She likes Gucci Bloom by Gucci, but deplores the fact that it doesn't hold much on her. It is true that the imagery around this very ethereal perfume suits her well. But apparently the other flankers of Gucci Bloom don't hold much on many people either...

She has had sweeter, fruitier perfumes before, but every time she soon gets tired of them. She changes a lot of fragrances, but told me that she would like to find her signature scent. She doesn't

1610895696,Perfumes,"What makes a good perfume? Is it personal taste, and how much does the body of the wearer influence the smell?","Is is personal, or does the majority agree on a scent being good?  
Can a perfume be good or bad, depending on who is wearing it, is that how much a body can change the smell? Or is it really only for the very sharp noses among us who can smell the difference?

I understand it depends on whether it's strong, fresh, sweet, fruity, and so on. Just yesterday I had tested a perfume (as a man, for men) which was rather strong, much like a deodorant. Reminded me it smelled as strong as smelling whiskey, but that could be because the saleslady sprayed a full dose on my wrist, instead of spreading it over my body at that point as I usually would myself. So I don't know how it would have really smelled like on myself.

The other scent on my other wrist I could barely smell, it was like it wasn't really there. Tho it was sweeter, so probably not as stimulating, but just as much present.  


Anyhow, I got salestalked and bought 4 vails one of each, strongly considering to just bring it back since I only ""woke up"" later that evening and it wasn't my wisest purchase by a long shot. So I will try to return it, it's still packaged in the foil. But I want to use this opportunity to learn what a good perfume is and what to pay attention to?"

I keep thinking about a perfume I used to wear around 15 years ago(!) and I cannot for the life of me remember what it was.
It could be from Avon for all I know!

It‚Äôs a long shot but I wondered if anyone would recognise the description of the bottle...

It was a frosted glass bottle, and I remember it being an extremely pale green jade colour, however it may have been clear.
It was a tall bottle that tapered from the bottom up, with a flat cylindrical bottom tapering up to a skinny neck and a silver spray thing - I don‚Äôt remember what the lid looked like or anything!
I remember the smell being a really fresh smell but can‚Äôt remember the characteristics of it outside of that - but I used to get compliments on it all of the time. I only wish I could remember what it even was and it torments me even now! Haha

Any ideas anyone?!"

1612317646,Perfumes,Mini review on 5 warmer/muskier perfumes based on suggestions I got from this subreddit üòå,"Replica By the Fireplace: a lot of people said that it smells like a camp fire and is better suited as a candle fragrance, but I disagree! On first spray it smelled smokey and spicy (like a campfire lol) but as it dried down it started to smell so nostalgically beautiful of sweet marshmallows with a gentle smokiness trailing it. I understand why people feel it works better as a room spray or something, however on my skin its delicately sweet with a little something extra

Narciso Rodriguez Pure Musc: I personally don't like any of the NR perfumes I'm about to review lol but this one does not read as musk to me. It just smells like a powdery grandma.

NR for her: this smells like coco chanel but with a lot of rose, which to me is extremely unpleasant because I despise the smell of roses lol

NR fluer Musc: this perfume also smells quite powdery and reminds me of marc jacobs daisy perfume but a little bit brighter and less offensive (again, not a fan of florals but this one is ok. It might be nice in the summer time!) 

Aerin Amber Musk: this initially smells very warm and simple (meaning not a ton of notes going on, just a pleasant amber scent) but then as it dries down and wears it just smells like a powdery grandmother üôÉ

Thus my uni is still open for lectures, study rooms are available, coffee shops are open etc. all done in safe manners.

I've never really used any perfume in my life except for certain situations like parties, celebrations etc. where I used some [Sergio Tacchini Stile](https://www.google.com/search?q=sergio+tacchini+stile&amp;safe=active&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03ewYnQpZzjlZXDtte-5OXeiX0-3g:1606947420356&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjRzKbRqbDtAhUllosKHc6nAFkQ_AUoAXoECBAQAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=937#imgrc=131fcSwmKhKPOM) that I got as a birthday gift some years ago. It has worked well, but a family member told me I should spice things up a bit, to which I agree with. I'd like to be presentable to the other students/classmates that I'll meet and get to know.

And also as weird as it may sound, I'd like to attract especially the girls/women as I'd like to go out on potential dates/date nights because this uni is told to be a very attractive place to seek and have dates on. I know smell isn't everything but I just want my perfume to contribute on top of me as a person. 

Last but not least as a student, money is a concern but based on my current expenses I'm saving about an equivalent of 157 USD per month so I think I'm ready to invest a little if that means I'm getting a greater perfume.

So, any suggestions/recommendations?"

I am starting with a few that I like the scent on and plan on using chlo√® edp, Burberry her, flowerbomb, dolce and gabbana dolce, Marc jacobs daisy love and victor and Rolf Bon Bon. 

If anyone has suggestions of what I should try let me know."

1607539275,Perfumes,Glossier You - Or Why I Love Fragrance," Fragrance, like many things, is highly subjective. My mother loves vibrant white florals, my father prefers rich amber and vanilla notes, and I tend to lean towards gourmands and fruity notes, but I appreciate many different fragrance families. I have a modest but growing collection of full sizes and samples and my two favorite fragrances are **BR540** and **Black Orchid**. I appreciate a challenging fragrance, even if it's not my thing.

That being said, nothing prepared me for the olfactory hellscape I experienced today when I received my package of **Glossier You** in the mail. I had purchased it for 25% off on Cyber Monday, and had been wanting to buy it for a long time based on its rave reviews. It arrived in a cute, Millennial pink package with a small vinyl collectible sticker. My hands trembled with anticipation as I held the minimalist bottle in my hands. I uncapped the bottle.

As a musk/""your skin but better"" lover, I had been excited to smell this for quite some time. The notes are listed as iris root, pink pepper, ambrette, ambrox, and musk. Nothing too offensive or something I could ever imagine disliking. 

I was wrong.

Smelling nothing from the bottle directly, I proceeded to spray my wrists and chest liberally and was immediately slapped in the face by a pungent, indescribable, awful cloud of *something* that I've never smelled in a fragrance and never ever want to smell again. It immediately turned my stomach and triggered my fight or flight response. Panicked, I ran down the hall to ask my husband's opinion. He shoved his nostrils onto my wrist, and his soured, crinkled-up face told me everything I needed to know. 

""Oh, honey, it smells like asparagus pee. Like the pee after you eat asparagus.""

While I could not discern that specific note, it dawned on me that I *could* now detect a tangible atmosphere in this putrid cloud. That hellish *something* convalesced into an olfactory evocation that I wish my brain hadn't conjured. I sniffed my wrists again and I immediately envisioned an old, musty library full of octogenarian women eating butternut squash soup in unison. It smelled somehow like old paper, old powder, denture cream, and wet synthetic gourd vegetables simultaneously. It was utterly disgusting. I announced this revelation to my husband and promptly scrubbed my skin of the foul liquid, looked up Glossier's return policy, and sent an email to customer service.

I am not writing this to dissuade anyone from purchasing **Glossier You.** In fact, I'm writing this because despite my violent aversion to **Glossier You,** delving into the world of fragrance has allowed me to become so affected by a scent that the experience itself becomes a story. A few years ago, I embarked on a road trip by myself with nothing but a few camping supplies and a new pair of red Converse on my feet. The first night I set up camp, I met a group of Appalachian Trail hikers staying at the site next to mine. They were around my age and they were dirty, tired, and welcoming. We all swapped campfire tales over beers and at one point, they asked me about my trip and I sheepishly confessed that I just wanted to see if I could do it. I told them I was worried about things going wrong. One of the women in the group looked at me and said, ""When things go wrong, it's a better story."" 

That stuck with me. Life is full of **Glossier You's** and no one can tell you when they'll pop up. Unexpected twists and turns and quirks. Overhyped experiences that fall flat or utterly disappoint you. No matter what, there will always be a **Glossier You** to experience and overcome and laugh about. Better yet, one person's **Glossier You** might be another person's **Black Orchid.** I'm glad I met my first scrubber today, and that it provided me the opportunity to think deeply about why I enjoy this hobby. And thank you, Glossier, for providing me with the opportunity to tell a good story."

**Beyond For Men 1702 (JPG Ultra Male)**

A very sweet pear scent which definitely rivals Eros for a ‚Äúgoing out‚Äù fragrance. The opening of this is wonderful, I wore this to a small birthday gathering for a friend and received multiple compliments. I‚Äôd say the fragrance is very close to the original, it has the sweet playful notes with a bit of the JPG dna. This lasts a long time as I could smell it on my jacket the next day and it was still projecting. I really enjoyed this scent and I‚Äôm going to get a bottle of the real deal since apparently it‚Äôs being discontinued. 

Performance was good lasting for 12 hours on me and projects great also at about 2/3 feet. 

**Overall: 8.5/10**

___


**Tranquil Perfume For Men 0678 (The Scent of Peace)**

A very nice pineapple and bergamot opening, unfortunately I don‚Äôt have a sample of the real SoP so I can‚Äôt comment on how close it is to the original but as a fragrance it is very nice regardless. This is a safe office scent and won‚Äôt offend anyone. The dry down is a very smooth with vetiver and fruity notes. The scent trail this leaves is great and I understand the comparisons to Aventus however this takes is a very juicy fruity scent. I do enjoy wearing this fragrance but I doubt I‚Äôll be picking up a bigger bottle. 

The projection is okay and performance was decent lasting about 5ish hours on my skin. 

**Overall: 7.5/10**

___


**Italian Gent For Men 1521 (Prada L‚ÄôHomme)**

I was very pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this. The opening is similar and has the same vibe as the original but it‚Äôs not quite there. The dry down however is identical and wearing this to the library my friends commented twice one how good I smelled and even asked what I was wearing. A very fresh and clean scent as has been said a million times before. Can‚Äôt go wrong with this, great pick up. 

Performance was okay lasted around 5/6 hours on my skin and wasn‚Äôt the best projector but it lingers for a while on my clothes and it doesn‚Äôt offend anyone. 

**Overall: 8/10**

___


**Navy Intense For Men 0061 (BdC EDP)**

Another great scent! This one isn‚Äôt that close to me, it has a similar vibe and does have the BdC DNA but that Chanel ‚Äúmagic‚Äù isn‚Äôt there. BdC Parfum was the scent that got me interested in fragrance in the first place and this doesn‚Äôt scratch that itch but it‚Äôs to be expected with such a price difference. This is a very clean and mass appealing scent, it‚Äôs very nice and I‚Äôve received compliments from friends. 

The performance was okay at about 6 hours on me with projection at 1/2 feet for a couple hours. This is no beast in performance but a safe fragrance I can recommend to anyone. 

**Overall: 8/10**

___


**Pioneer For Men 0738 (MB Explorer)**

Wow. This is an amazing scent definitely one of my favourites. When I first smelled this I thought it smelled exactly like Sauvage but once I let it rest in a cool dark place for a couple weeks and it came back even better. There‚Äôs a strong bergamot opening similar to the original and the dry down is a lot less loud as the opening. I couldn‚Äôt smell the leather note as strong as the original but the black currant accord was coming through for sure. My friends really enjoyed this one also and this is another one I‚Äôll be considering for a full bottle also! 

This lasted well for about 5/6 hours on me but the projection was great at about 2 feet. This left a strong scent trail as I walked past and I could smell it on myself now and then. 

**Overall: 8.5/10** 

___


**Wood Fire 1874 (MM By The Fireplace)**

This smells exactly the same to me as the original. The original is a bit brighter and not as dense as the PP in the opening but the dry down is identical. The scent is nice but not something I can see myself wearing often. A sweet and warm fragrance, I get the burnt marshmallow and burning wood warmth that everyone talks about with this scent. I can see this being great on a winters night and the name ‚ÄòBy The Fireplace‚Äô is a great way to describe this fragrance. 

Performance is good, I could smell this on my jumper the next day and projection is okay at about 1 foot but it does linger for a while. 

**Overall: 7/10**

___


**Pennine For Men 1008 (PdM Carlisle)**

I have very mixed emotions with this one. It was quite hyped up especially from YouTubers online such as FragMental. I‚Äôm not a massive fan of the almond note in this and the whole scent as a whole is probably my least favourite PP that I‚Äôve bought. The scent is quite strong and does develop further in the dry down with a lot more patchouli but I can‚Äôt get past the initial spray. I‚Äôve also received mixed reviews for this frag from friends as some don‚Äôt like it but others love it. 

The performance was great I could smell this all day for over 8 hours and projection was good as well at 1 to 2 feet for hours. 

**Overall: 5/10**

___


**Final Comments:**
I‚Äôve ordered many Perfume Parlour clones and I‚Äôve been happy with the majority of them. PP is even much cheaper than decants and because of that I‚Äôve been able to experiment and try different fragrances at a fraction of the price. I will be ordering more from PP soon however I think the next purchase for me will be Ultra Male. This is one of my favourite PP scents to date and it‚Äôs convinced me to get a full bottle of the real thing. 

I‚Äôve learnt that although I enjoy the smell of darker, more dense fragrances such as Pure Havane, Noir de Noir, Tuscan Leather and By The Fireplace; I don‚Äôt think I can pull them off. I feel much more confident and enjoy myself wearing more fresh and clean - ‚Äúshower gel‚Äù type fragrances. I will be keeping the bottles I have so far and wear them every so often but the more citrus and sweet scents are what I really enjoy. 

I‚Äôm not sure on what my next order, I am open to suggestions, however I‚Äôm interested in getting PP‚Äôs Aventus clone ‚ÄúAvalanche Woody 1848‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure which of their Aventus clones is best so if anyone has any experience with any of them and their opinions I‚Äôd love to hear them!"

# 2: New Limited Edition Bottles

So a lot of customers requested better-looking bottles.

 We decided to listen to them and we got test quantity for these specific ones [https://imgur.com/a/gIudAgf](https://imgur.com/a/gIudAgf)

300 of these will be available until they go out of stock.

They are available in 55ml and 75ml.

If you have any suggestions about new bottles, I would love to hear that!

# 3: Cosmetics

Always wanted to get a gift for a family next to the perfumes?

Well, now the cosmetic section is available on the website!

Shipping is a flat rate so if you take perfumes, you can take them too for the same shipping price.

Did I mention prices are also fair and not high?

# 4: Question for the community

Could you please give me overall feedback?

What should I fix, what should I improve, what should I add, etc..

Something that I have in mind is:

\-candles that are inspired by famous perfumes

\-Tester of paper that holds perfume so I can ship a few of them in every order!

If you have any idea, please share it and it might happen in 2021!

Thank you so much for the support, I appreciate it!

Much love,

Perfume Guy

1609280188,Perfumes,Perfume that smells of warmth and decadent sweets?,"Hi all,

First time here in this sub. I‚Äôve been on the search for a long lasting, good-quality, perfume. With COVID, I can‚Äôt (and don‚Äôt want to) test any scents in stores nor go to stores unless it‚Äôs a necessity.
With that said, my taste in scents is warm and sweet, but with some woody, sandalwood aspects.

I love the Soap and Glory body spray, ‚ÄúSmoothie Star‚Äù:

‚ÄúThis sweet, nutty gourmand fragrance is filled with mouthwatering almonds, hazelnut and citrus, on a heart of maple syrup and vanilla. The fragrance leaves a delicious finish of sandalwood and amber.‚Äù


I also am in love with Lush‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Home‚Äù:


‚ÄúFrom the bottle, I'm Home offers two very distinctive notes - a sweet, musky layer of vanilla, and a rich, powdery sprinkling of cocoa absolute. The latter is very robust from the get-go and almost blankets the vanilla slightly - offering a smell that reminds me of an expensive vanilla ice cream decorated with a generous sprinkling of cocoa powder or hot, dark chocolate sauce.‚Äù


I also love men‚Äôs colognes scents. The crisp, sharp smells that are clean and green and shmexy. If there is something out there that I should know about along these lines, please share.



Thank you all and stay safeüñ§"

I am an 18 year old girl, in college! My price range is maximum $120 (I usually get a 1 oz bottle). I live in California, so it is quite sunny here! 

I would describe myself as someone who is is outgoing, loving, free spirit, and always smiling. My friends tell me I remind them of sunshine lol.

I don‚Äôt want a sophisticated/woody/spicy/mysterious/powdery scent. 
I want one that is youthful, fruity and floral and sweet (like honey, rasberries, strawberries, warm florals, vanilla), and a longevity of 5+ hours (eau de parfum). 

Also, I don‚Äôt want the scent to be too overpowering/smell like chemicals, but I don‚Äôt want it to be light and one that can barely be noticed. Right in the middle as one that people that stand near me can smell, and be like ‚Äúwow! she smells good!‚Äù

However, we‚Äôre having some trouble because I‚Äôm really into sweet &amp; fruity scents and he‚Äôs more into clean and floral ones. I‚Äôd like to find something we both really love where neither of us needs to compromise too much. I think so far that means nixing the sweet component and sticking to a predominately floral scent with fruity tones. Maybe something with lilac, lavender, or violet? We went to check out some scents today but we didn‚Äôt find anything quite right. He really liked Ralph Lauren Blue and Jenifer Aniston Chapter II, but I found them a little overpowering for me. The ones I was really drawn to were super sweet or coconutty which he very much dislikes. Any suggestions?

I‚Äôd love to start a conversation about the (according to your own nose of course) unremarkable fragrances in your collection. The ones that (your nose) finds to be rather blah or just meh. But you still can‚Äôt help loving and wearing them. They don‚Äôt scream for attention and might be terribly safe or mainstream but still your love persists.

It‚Äôs not about what others find to be blah or meh, it has to be a scent that you find unremarkable, but you love it. Oooh the irony of it all!

For example, mine would be Aquolina Pink Sugar. It‚Äôs sweet, it‚Äôs cotton candy, and that‚Äôs about all I can say. Meh. But I was 23 when it came out and all my friends and I were in love. I think it remains in constant rotation for nearly 20 years for that reason alone. Perhaps nothing special to my nose, but she‚Äôs got my loyalty!

When I was younger, my go to's were D&amp;G Light Blue, Paris Hilton, Versace Bright Crystal, Escada Rockin Rio, and Philosophy Amazing Grace. Mostly light and sweet/fruity/floral scents, in my opinion.

I've been using Romance by Ralph Lauren and Rose Jam from Lush. Though they smell nice, I'm not 100% sure if I'd like to stick to any of them.

I recently bought Philosophy Amazing Grace again because of nostalgia (and because it was on sale) but I don't know, I guess I don't like the scent as much anymore.

Maybe my preference has changed so I tried to go for something more mature and warm. I sampled Angel by Thierry Mugler and Tom Ford Fucking Fabulous, but ended up not liking both of them. To me, they smell sweet but very musky -- kinda reminds me of my grandma's scent. 

So now I'm quite confused, I don't know what I should try next. Any recommendations please? Thanks!"

Why??? Was my mistake putting on perfume and then getting dressed?? Should I start looking for a new combination? Because I do not spend over 100‚Ç¨ in smells to be outshined by fucking detergent. Or should I wash my clothes with some perfume or something? I had washed my clothes like a week prior I just keep them all folded with more clean clothes so may be the smell remained?

I‚Äôve been wearing cologne/fragrance for a few years now, I‚Äôm a 20 year old guy, I‚Äôm not any sort of big clubber/ f boy/ etc although I love getting extremely over the top every once in a while, apart from that I‚Äôm chill, relax and have a chat sort of person, maybe my fragrance choices below will help as well?

I‚Äôve been wearing CH Priv√© for a couple years, probably my #1, I recently (read today xD) bought the sauvage EDP which I love (I really like the parfum but doesn‚Äôt project as well/ last as long).

For my fresher scents I‚Äôve got Jean Paul Gautier le male, which I like but I do find disappears quick, and Pierre Cardin pour homme (cheap and only lasts 30 minutes).

When thinking of suggestions, I like the smell of one million for example, but would NEVER EVER wear it. I also recently smelt terre d‚Äôhermes which I like, but it smell a bit like millipedes to me ( I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up with my brain)

So I‚Äôm looking for ideas for something long lasting, yet nothing like what I have, something that could be worn anywhere, but I‚Äôm open to more specific smells if they‚Äôre good enough.

Any compliment grabbers are appreciated, but not so common you smell them everywhere you go.

Budget isn‚Äôt a problem, I don‚Äôt mind spending the money if it‚Äôs worth it

Yes, I saved this maybe five year old bottle. No, I haven‚Äôt used it up. Last time I used it was when I met my now fianc√©e, hence one of the reasons it means so much to me.

So now for example, if you want to buy 5x20ml, the weight will be 165g +80g from box = 245g (125-250g price)

That's almost twice as cheaper as the previous price was.

# New Arrivals

We also added 3 new perfumes

Inspired by:

Montale Intense Cafe - Coffee Dream

Dior J'adiore - Bredore

Jean-Paul Gaultier Scandal - Drama Queen

They are available now on the website

# Maldives

I'll be traveling to the Maldives on 17th February. If any RepFam is in the Maldives on that period, please hit me before that date and I'll bring you some perfume to try out and chill.

Again thank you very much for the support, and if you need any help, please let me know and I will be happy to help,

Much Love,

Chez

1610384106,Perfumes,Hello! I‚Äôm looking for a ‚Äúknock off‚Äù or similar scent to Victoria Secret Sweet Daydream,"Hello! My girlfriend absolutely adores the ‚ÄúSweet Daydream‚Äù perfume set from Victoria Secret! She has the lotion and body mist but doesn‚Äôt use it nearly as much as she would like on account of the perfume being discontinued.

 The exact description of this perfumes scents are:

-A blissful blend of raspberry, apple and vanilla. It belongs to the Secret Garden collection.

It‚Äôs also described as being fruity, sweet, vanilla, and powdery!

I'm not generally a fan of B&amp;BW perfumes, but I reallllly liked this one. It smelled so good, just didn't last long. They discontinued this scent, and the bottle I have is near empty. I don't particularly feel like buying a bottle off eBay, so I've been trying to find something similarly smelling with no luck.

The scent description is ""soft sea breeze, salty ocean waves &amp; crisp aquatic florals."" I would say it's not traditionally a ""male"" or a ""female"" scent; it could go either way."

1604495319,Perfumes,How to apply perfume?,"The fragrance is an invisible part of your personal style. Your [fragrance will always be the first impression](https://vforged.com/top-10-best-fragrances-for-women-2020/) of you while entering a place, and the lasting impression when you leave.  

 **1. After Shower:** Your skin absorbs perfume better when it is warm.

**2. Hydrate your Skin:** Apply moisturizer before applying perfume. It protects the skin from chemicals and also helps the perfume to stay on the surface longer.¬†

**3.** **Hold fragrance away from your body:** The distance should be at least 5-7 inches away from the body.

**4. Apply on the pulse points:**¬†Spray perfume onto your ‚Äúpulse points.‚Äù like Behind earlobes, on the neck, on wrists, elbows, etc.

**Pro Tip:** Don‚Äôt rub after apply fragrance, it will fade away the fragrance very soon. Let it dry itself.?"

Does anyone have any recommendations for similar scents? 

I've also considered kind of delving into making my own dupe of it, mixing essential oils and such into a lotion base or something. That's the weird part of this post lol.

1604932013,Perfumes,Looking for a citrusy magnolia scent,"Growing up there were these huge, beautiful magnolia trees in my neighborhood that smelled so good and I‚Äôve been trying to find a scent that matches it for a long time. The magnolias where I grew up are more tropical, they‚Äôre the kind with large shiny waxy leaves and fat white flowers. They have more of a citrusy scent, not the powdery one you smell in magnolias that grow in colder climates.

I really enjoy the top notes of Magnolia Nobile by Acqua di Parma, but the dry down is very powdery/vanilla, which is not what I‚Äôm after. I‚Äôve also tried a lot of Chloe scents bc I know they‚Äôre supposed to have magnolia but those weren‚Äôt right either.

I would go to a perfume shop if i could but as soon as i step in it triggers my gag reflux and i find it hard to breathe (i'm not allergic but if i breathe in i taste the perfume if that makes sense). I really love scents like grapefruit, lemon, orange, musk, freesia and ylang ylang. I love clean scents as well. Aside from the flowers i mentioned i tend to avoid florals especially the smell of roses and cherry blossoms. if you guys have any suggestions i'd love to hear them!"

My addiction started out by asking my husband for bottles of Juicy Couture and Angel for Xmas and he totally came through! This was the beginning of my excessive arm sniffing tendencies. 

The nest year i asked for Chanel N¬∞5 and received both the parfum and the eau de parfum as well, and I was in heaven.

I had run out of the CCM That I bought with my Xmas money last year as 5 bought the smallest bottle, telling myself I would conserve it( HA!!!! Maybe when hell freezes over) and my husband gifted me the whopping 3.4oz for my birthday! This is definitely my signature scent, and it took me years to figure that out! CCM is! chic and sophisticated and in a way it pulls .my whole look together and I feel a certain vibe of elegance even if I'm just wearing jeans and a tee shirt !

I was looking for some mini parfum versions from Serge Lutens. With some simple keywords from Google ([Link](https://www.google.com/search?q=serge+lutens+miniature+chergui&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enFR837FR837&amp;oq=serge+lutens+miniature+chergui&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3.7648j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)), I was directed straight forward to official Serge Luten website. However, these are surprisingly  0 EUR (Free).  I did some extra search and found out there were at least 4 of them with 0 EUR.

I'm a 22 yo guy, pretty tall, into sports like Parkour, the great outdoors, knives, metal-/woodworking and such. Not really the social type. Also not the guy to wear a suit. Long hair, never too serious, I think you get the picture. 
I really want to feel more comfortable around people, and one way I figured is to smell great!
Sadly, I have no clue what to look for in a nice perfume or even how to wear one.
Hence is why I'm here. 

I love smells like licorice, freshly dug up earth, vanilla, green tea and wood (that's a big one!).

I'd be very thankful for any and all recommendation, even if it's a completely different smell than what I've listed and you just think I should give it a go!

I think it smells like a wet dog that rolled around in some rotting seaweed and dead fish, and then wound up walking into a poorly cleaned up crime scene...a bloody one, and also rolled around in that.

It is one of the most revolting things I have EVER smelled and I cannot believe that some people would spend $100 to smell like that!

1605988054,Perfumes,Chanel Coco Noir - confusing!,"I'm having a really hard time deciding if I like this fragrance or not... It seems to get mixed reviews online, though mostly positive. I LOVE Chanel Coco which I own, and I have a sample of Coco Mademoiselle which I find very pleasantly sweet and youthful smelling (after the dry-down), though not necessarily ""me"". I prefer darker spicy floral oriental scents, so I figured Noir would be perfect.

I sprayed Coco Noir on my wrist last night. I find it... intriguing? It reminds me of Coco Mademoiselle more-so than my beloved Coco. The initial blast smells incredible and magical and spicy to me - almost unisex, then it goes into this ""sour"" citrusy mode for an hour or so. After that... it's pleasant floral and a little spicy/powdery, but nothing overpowering, yet this peachy note persists throughout. It's odd how it morphs over time, I've never owned a fragrance that had such noticeable transitions like this. 

My dilemma is that I can't tell if I like it or not? This scent is definitely a journey! I could do without the sourness in the first hour, it's a bit much. But after that it's kind of lovely. I don't know that I would refer to it as ""dark""? It is pleasant though as I find myself constantly smelling my wrist when I test it. I'm going to test it tonight when I see my boyfriend and see what he thinks...

What do you all think of this fragrance? Does anyone else have this same dilemma? Or do you know of other fragrances that behave this way?"
1606012120,Perfumes,Reccomend me your favourite summer holiday scents!,"TL;DR - Reccomend summery scents of coconut, pineapple, mango, suncream etc.

I'm not sure if this nostalgia lies within everyone since we all come from different places. I'm from the UK, and 'summer holidays' are a thing here. Basically when you and your family or friends fly to usually Spain, Portugal, Canary Islands etc and spend 2 weeks in the scorching sunüåû And personally, a huge part of summer nostalgia is the smell of suncream, pina coladas and just golden sunlight (I know that's not a smell but surely some of you will relate!)

I'm looking for any reccomend actions at all because I'd love to try out some new scents that have this vibe. I've already tried a couple, but I doubt I'll get tired of it and although lots of them contain the same scents, I find many to still smell different and interesting from eachother.

My favourite isn't a perfume but actually a scented moisturiser: Island Coconut Mango by The Fox Tan"
1606013215,Perfumes,Does anybody else feel their preference in scents doesn't 'suit' them?,"Just a random discussion because this is on my mind a lot!

I'm a female, 19 years old. The past 10 years or so of my school life, I've been surrounded by girls wearing super sweet and sickly scents as they spray their VS Lovespell body mist into the classroom for the 100th time. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy those scents too sometimes. I own VS Bombshell (and another small pink one I can't remember the name of!) however I do think that's one of their scents that is less sweet, more sultry and honestly, a bit masculine?

I also love floral and holiday type scents. However, my absolute favourite perfume is Vanderbilt. Which is a cheap perfume, less than ¬£10 so it's probably a dupe for something I'm not aware of. My problem is that although I love it, I feel like it gives off vibes of a typical 'granny' perfume? I never wear it to work because I'm afraid people will think it's an odd scent and too old for me. I know the correct answer is that I shouldn't care what people think, but I don't feel that's completely fair as I can usually never smell myself after 15 minutes but I sometimes get compliments hours later from other people, so if they're the ones smelling it then I don't want it to be weird! Although I'd rather smell of luxurious granny than of something that's actually bad, lol.

Any other experiences like this? :("

1606077455,Perfumes,Please help!,"My mother passed away in 2008. I kept her perfume that she wore the most and reminded me of her. Don't ask me why but when I moved out of my dad's house 6 years ago I didn't bring it with me. I thought it would be safe but my dad just told me that he cleaned out my old room a few months ago and threw everything away.

I can't really remember the scent but it was a perfume that came out earlier than the fall of 2008 (when she passed). If I had to guess I'd say she bought it 2006 or before. The bottle was clear and a hexagon shape but if the hexagon was squished down and elongated along the x-axis with rounded corners. The cap was spiraled and came to a point and was fairly large compared to the size of the bottle. The perfume itself was clear or a very light amber color. Most likely under about $150 as I cant see her having spent too much money on it.

I am sorry if my description is awful but I am kind of desperate to find the perfume again! Any help would be appreciated!!"

L'Oreal has cheapen out the whole Maison Lancome line by pretty much destroying the original design of the bottles (2 gold plaques, one with the name and assemblage, the other one with the flowers). Instead, they only kept 1 gold plaque with the perfume name and the flowers on the same side. 

I'm so frustrated over this change. The bottles were one of the reasons why I loved this line; it gave me joy to look at them. I am testing the perfume now to see if they have reformulated Jasmins Marzipane or Oud Bouquet. It would piss me off even further if they really did that."

1606614435,Perfumes,Please help me replace my favorite discontinued perfume!,"Hello! Longtime lurker on this subreddit and first-time poster.  Years ago, I bought a small perfume called ""Aquarius"" at a Miniso store in Bangalore, India.

It went out of production and seems to be unavailable worldwide, except in the philippines. 

I have a teeny tiny amount left in the bottle that I dare not use because I may never smell it again.. Please, perfume reddit! How do I find out what this magical fragrance is??

The only notes listed on the Miniso website are ""citrus"" and ""floral."" The back label of the bottle says ""a bright, watery scent."" I've spent years trying to buy perfumes that I think sound similar, but nothing smells remotely close.

1606948383,Perfumes,Recommendations on perfume(s) for a university student?,"I'm 20M and going to study at a university next semester in a country that never officially went into a COVID-19 lockdown but is executing all the safety precautions necessary. Thus my uni is still open for lectures, study rooms are available, coffee shops are open etc. all done in safe manners.

I've never really used any perfume in my life except for certain situations like parties, celebrations etc. where I used some [Sergio Tacchini Stile](https://www.google.com/search?q=sergio+tacchini+stile&amp;safe=active&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03ewYnQpZzjlZXDtte-5OXeiX0-3g:1606947420356&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjRzKbRqbDtAhUllosKHc6nAFkQ_AUoAXoECBAQAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=937#imgrc=131fcSwmKhKPOM) that I got as a birthday gift some years ago. It has worked well, but a family member told me I should spice things up a bit, to which I agree with. I'd like to be presentable to the other students/classmates that I'll meet and get to know.

And also as weird as it may sound, I'd like to attract especially the girls/women as I'd like to go out on potential dates/date nights because this uni is told to be a very attractive place to seek and have dates on. I know smell isn't everything but I just want my perfume to contribute on top of me as a person. 

Last but not least as a student, money is a concern but based on my current expenses I'm saving about an equivalent of 157 USD per month so I think I'm ready to invest a little if that means I'm getting a greater perfume.

So, any suggestions/recommendations?"

I just got a Bvlgari sample of Rose Goldea Blossom Delight and I can‚Äôt decide if I like or hate it. When spritzing it I‚Äôm overwhelmed by how soapy and sharp it is but if applied to my skin it mellows down in 20-30 minutes and I like it much better. 

There are so many good perfumes out there but my limited experience so far is that pretty much everything smells different straight out of the bottle vs when actually wearing it. Should I put up with 20 minutes of irritating my nose every time I put it on in order to smell nice for the next few hours after that? Is this something I‚Äôve got to get used to when using stronger Eau de Parfum rather than the weaker Toilettes and Colognes?

1607539275,Perfumes,Glossier You - Or Why I Love Fragrance," Fragrance, like many things, is highly subjective. My mother loves vibrant white florals, my father prefers rich amber and vanilla notes, and I tend to lean towards gourmands and fruity notes, but I appreciate many different fragrance families. I have a modest but growing collection of full sizes and samples and my two favorite fragrances are **BR540** and **Black Orchid**. I appreciate a challenging fragrance, even if it's not my thing.

That being said, nothing prepared me for the olfactory hellscape I experienced today when I received my package of **Glossier You** in the mail. I had purchased it for 25% off on Cyber Monday, and had been wanting to buy it for a long time based on its rave reviews. It arrived in a cute, Millennial pink package with a small vinyl collectible sticker. My hands trembled with anticipation as I held the minimalist bottle in my hands. I uncapped the bottle.

As a musk/""your skin but better"" lover, I had been excited to smell this for quite some time. The notes are listed as iris root, pink pepper, ambrette, ambrox, and musk. Nothing too offensive or something I could ever imagine disliking. 

I was wrong.

Smelling nothing from the bottle directly, I proceeded to spray my wrists and chest liberally and was immediately slapped in the face by a pungent, indescribable, awful cloud of *something* that I've never smelled in a fragrance and never ever want to smell again. It immediately turned my stomach and triggered my fight or flight response. Panicked, I ran down the hall to ask my husband's opinion. He shoved his nostrils onto my wrist, and his soured, crinkled-up face told me everything I needed to know. 

""Oh, honey, it smells like asparagus pee. Like the pee after you eat asparagus.""

While I could not discern that specific note, it dawned on me that I *could* now detect a tangible atmosphere in this putrid cloud. That hellish *something* convalesced into an olfactory evocation that I wish my brain hadn't conjured. I sniffed my wrists again and I immediately envisioned an old, musty library full of octogenarian women eating butternut squash soup in unison. It smelled somehow like old paper, old powder, denture cream, and wet synthetic gourd vegetables simultaneously. It was utterly disgusting. I announced this revelation to my husband and promptly scrubbed my skin of the foul liquid, looked up Glossier's return policy, and sent an email to customer service.

I am not writing this to dissuade anyone from purchasing **Glossier You.** In fact, I'm writing this because despite my violent aversion to **Glossier You,** delving into the world of fragrance has allowed me to become so affected by a scent that the experience itself becomes a story. A few years ago, I embarked on a road trip by myself with nothing but a few camping supplies and a new pair of red Converse on my feet. The first night I set up camp, I met a group of Appalachian Trail hikers staying at the site next to mine. They were around my age and they were dirty, tired, and welcoming. We all swapped campfire tales over beers and at one point, they asked me about my trip and I sheepishly confessed that I just wanted to see if I could do it. I told them I was worried about things going wrong. One of the women in the group looked at me and said, ""When things go wrong, it's a better story."" 

That stuck with me. Life is full of **Glossier You's** and no one can tell you when they'll pop up. Unexpected twists and turns and quirks. Overhyped experiences that fall flat or utterly disappoint you. No matter what, there will always be a **Glossier You** to experience and overcome and laugh about. Better yet, one person's **Glossier You** might be another person's **Black Orchid.** I'm glad I met my first scrubber today, and that it provided me the opportunity to think deeply about why I enjoy this hobby. And thank you, Glossier, for providing me with the opportunity to tell a good story."

How similar are these scents usually? Are brands just trying to trade on the name of popular scents to draw customers in or are they actually similar in design?

**Beyond For Men 1702 (JPG Ultra Male)**

A very sweet pear scent which definitely rivals Eros for a ‚Äúgoing out‚Äù fragrance. The opening of this is wonderful, I wore this to a small birthday gathering for a friend and received multiple compliments. I‚Äôd say the fragrance is very close to the original, it has the sweet playful notes with a bit of the JPG dna. This lasts a long time as I could smell it on my jacket the next day and it was still projecting. I really enjoyed this scent and I‚Äôm going to get a bottle of the real deal since apparently it‚Äôs being discontinued. 

Performance was good lasting for 12 hours on me and projects great also at about 2/3 feet. 

**Overall: 8.5/10**

___


**Tranquil Perfume For Men 0678 (The Scent of Peace)**

A very nice pineapple and bergamot opening, unfortunately I don‚Äôt have a sample of the real SoP so I can‚Äôt comment on how close it is to the original but as a fragrance it is very nice regardless. This is a safe office scent and won‚Äôt offend anyone. The dry down is a very smooth with vetiver and fruity notes. The scent trail this leaves is great and I understand the comparisons to Aventus however this takes is a very juicy fruity scent. I do enjoy wearing this fragrance but I doubt I‚Äôll be picking up a bigger bottle. 

The projection is okay and performance was decent lasting about 5ish hours on my skin. 

**Overall: 7.5/10**

___


**Italian Gent For Men 1521 (Prada L‚ÄôHomme)**

I was very pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this. The opening is similar and has the same vibe as the original but it‚Äôs not quite there. The dry down however is identical and wearing this to the library my friends commented twice one how good I smelled and even asked what I was wearing. A very fresh and clean scent as has been said a million times before. Can‚Äôt go wrong with this, great pick up. 

Performance was okay lasted around 5/6 hours on my skin and wasn‚Äôt the best projector but it lingers for a while on my clothes and it doesn‚Äôt offend anyone. 

**Overall: 8/10**

___


**Navy Intense For Men 0061 (BdC EDP)**

Another great scent! This one isn‚Äôt that close to me, it has a similar vibe and does have the BdC DNA but that Chanel ‚Äúmagic‚Äù isn‚Äôt there. BdC Parfum was the scent that got me interested in fragrance in the first place and this doesn‚Äôt scratch that itch but it‚Äôs to be expected with such a price difference. This is a very clean and mass appealing scent, it‚Äôs very nice and I‚Äôve received compliments from friends. 

The performance was okay at about 6 hours on me with projection at 1/2 feet for a couple hours. This is no beast in performance but a safe fragrance I can recommend to anyone. 

**Overall: 8/10**

___


**Pioneer For Men 0738 (MB Explorer)**

Wow. This is an amazing scent definitely one of my favourites. When I first smelled this I thought it smelled exactly like Sauvage but once I let it rest in a cool dark place for a couple weeks and it came back even better. There‚Äôs a strong bergamot opening similar to the original and the dry down is a lot less loud as the opening. I couldn‚Äôt smell the leather note as strong as the original but the black currant accord was coming through for sure. My friends really enjoyed this one also and this is another one I‚Äôll be considering for a full bottle also! 

This lasted well for about 5/6 hours on me but the projection was great at about 2 feet. This left a strong scent trail as I walked past and I could smell it on myself now and then. 

**Overall: 8.5/10** 

___


**Wood Fire 1874 (MM By The Fireplace)**

This smells exactly the same to me as the original. The original is a bit brighter and not as dense as the PP in the opening but the dry down is identical. The scent is nice but not something I can see myself wearing often. A sweet and warm fragrance, I get the burnt marshmallow and burning wood warmth that everyone talks about with this scent. I can see this being great on a winters night and the name ‚ÄòBy The Fireplace‚Äô is a great way to describe this fragrance. 

Performance is good, I could smell this on my jumper the next day and projection is okay at about 1 foot but it does linger for a while. 

**Overall: 7/10**

___


**Pennine For Men 1008 (PdM Carlisle)**

I have very mixed emotions with this one. It was quite hyped up especially from YouTubers online such as FragMental. I‚Äôm not a massive fan of the almond note in this and the whole scent as a whole is probably my least favourite PP that I‚Äôve bought. The scent is quite strong and does develop further in the dry down with a lot more patchouli but I can‚Äôt get past the initial spray. I‚Äôve also received mixed reviews for this frag from friends as some don‚Äôt like it but others love it. 

The performance was great I could smell this all day for over 8 hours and projection was good as well at 1 to 2 feet for hours. 

**Overall: 5/10**

___


**Final Comments:**
I‚Äôve ordered many Perfume Parlour clones and I‚Äôve been happy with the majority of them. PP is even much cheaper than decants and because of that I‚Äôve been able to experiment and try different fragrances at a fraction of the price. I will be ordering more from PP soon however I think the next purchase for me will be Ultra Male. This is one of my favourite PP scents to date and it‚Äôs convinced me to get a full bottle of the real thing. 

I‚Äôve learnt that although I enjoy the smell of darker, more dense fragrances such as Pure Havane, Noir de Noir, Tuscan Leather and By The Fireplace; I don‚Äôt think I can pull them off. I feel much more confident and enjoy myself wearing more fresh and clean - ‚Äúshower gel‚Äù type fragrances. I will be keeping the bottles I have so far and wear them every so often but the more citrus and sweet scents are what I really enjoy. 

I‚Äôm not sure on what my next order, I am open to suggestions, however I‚Äôm interested in getting PP‚Äôs Aventus clone ‚ÄúAvalanche Woody 1848‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure which of their Aventus clones is best so if anyone has any experience with any of them and their opinions I‚Äôd love to hear them!"

From bath bombs to car fresheners to cream perfumes, we have all available!

# 4: Question for the community

Could you please give me overall feedback?

What should I fix, what should I improve, what should I add, etc..

Something that I have in mind is:

\-candles that are inspired by famous perfumes

\-Tester of paper that holds perfume so I can ship a few of them in every order!

If you have any idea, please share it and it might happen in 2021!

Thank you so much for the support, I appreciate it!

Much love,

1601891029,Perfumes,Help on Finding a Discontinued Killian Perfume,"Hello! About two years ago I dug up an atomizer sample of this perfume by Killian that I LOVED. It was the perfect girly and delicate scent. It had notes of peach and smelled a little powdery. It was the perfect mix between fruity and powdery and it was a very soft scent. I went to Saks to see if I could figure out what it was. This is where I learned the name of the fragrance and that it was sadly discontinued. I don't think it had great reviews which might be why they discontinued it. I'm not much of a perfume wearer so I didn't pursue it further and I ended up forgetting the name of it :( When I tried googling ""peach powder Killian discontinued"" the only thing that came up was flower of immortality. I'm not a fan of that scent. I wanted to see if anyone could help me figure out what this fragrance might be! I've started wearing fragrance now and this is (or was) my perfect scent. :) I'm hoping that if I figure out what it was called, that I could find some good dupe fragrances out there. Thanks!"

1601918547,Perfumes,Helping finding autumnal scent,"Hi there. I hope some of you can assist.

Im not one for expensive perfumes and I don't very often wear them now that I'm mostly at home, but as autumn has arrived I've been feeling very inspired to try and find a perfect autumnal fragrance to boost my mood and feed my love of all things autumn, earthy and a teensy bit goth. 

My favourite scent is patchouli, and I used to love the solid perfumes from lush before they started using whatever it is that leaves a garish orange stain on the skin. The only other perfumes I loved were Givenchy Very Irr√©sistible and Bulgari Jasmine Noir.

To me, autumn smells like spices, patchouli, wood, moss and burning leaves. I really want something earthy and dark. Can anyone recommend any specific perfumes or point me in the right direction?

Appreciate this might be a slightly odd request. I am hoping that this exists somewhere out there and I'm just unaware!

Thanks so much."

I have seen many posts about obtaining the skill to identify different notes in perfumes. But I have a slightly related yet different question. 
Namely, one of my favorite perfumes ever is Tresor La Nuit and I know it‚Äôs labeled as a really sweet perfume but I simply can‚Äôt pick up the sweet notes in it. I actually realized it‚Äôs gourmand/sweet when my friend said I smell like cupcakes lol. 
What I actually like about Tresor LN is a certain sharpness it has, and barely/rarely sense the sweetness. 


I don‚Äôt think this has happened to me with another perfume, I am usually great at picking up and identifying the different notes so I was wondering, has something like this happened to anyone too?

Production Date:  2017-04 

I've been loyal to Armani Code for around 8 - 9 years already and I recently bought a new bottle. The seller said it was Authentic Tester and the whole presentation of the product seems legitimate. However, I noticed that its scent is quite different. The citrus note became more powerful and the leathery and tobacco notes seemed toned down. The original fragrance scent came from full-bodied into this presently light and fresh citrus. Its classiness worn off and now smells like something I would wear in a beach. Its originally 'sweet' aroma became 'sour'. Its well-rounded edges suddenly became sharp. It also smells like more diluted. Additionally, it has a decreased longevity and projection. Any of you had any experience same as mine? Or do you think I carelessly bought a fake one?"

 I guess most answers may be ""go to a shop and test them"" however i wanted to gain from insight from you guys to see if anyone had any other advice as its for a Christmas present. 

We are both 23, however he is very much an old man personality wise, he even usually dresses in a style much older than he is. 

Whereas most guys locally our age are in fancy trainers, skinny jeans and tight tops. My BF is often found in straight cut Levi's, a chequered shirt and brown chuck-boots.

I am looking to buy him a parfum for Christmas, up to ¬£100. Which would fit his older man style, he doesn't like fruity or citrus scents and needs something woody or tobacco smelling, something older and  manly. 

He hasn't had one since i have known him, but has asked for one for Christmas but not given me any brands or anything.

Does anyone have any recommendations, anyone use anything similar to this?"

I don't know what to do anymore as I have already spent so much time trying to find it, and asking her if she remembers which one it is constantly, lol.

I am thinking about Narciso Rodriguez For Her (the black rectangle bottle)/Poudr√©e/White Musc/Narciso (cubes, but definitely not the red one). How sweet NR fragrances are? 

I used l'Occitane La Terre de Lumi√®re because got it for Christmas. It was okay but I find it a bit too sweet. I liked the honey note though, it's so warming and the dryout is beautiful. Elie Saab Girl of Now - way too sweet for my taste. So cloying and sweet, the scent is annoying. Elizabeth Arden - White Tea - headache inducing. There are notes that clash with each other. I don't want to smell like roses. Something sexy enough but also safe for everyday wear. Something subtle."

 **1. After Shower:** Your skin absorbs perfume better when it is warm.

**2. Hydrate your Skin:** Apply moisturizer before applying perfume. It protects the skin from chemicals and also helps the perfume to stay on the surface longer.¬†

**3.** **Hold fragrance away from your body:** The distance should be at least 5-7 inches away from the body.

**4. Apply on the pulse points:**¬†Spray perfume onto your ‚Äúpulse points.‚Äù like Behind earlobes, on the neck, on wrists, elbows, etc.

**Pro Tip:** Don‚Äôt rub after apply fragrance, it will fade away the fragrance very soon. Let it dry itself.?"

1604932013,Perfumes,Looking for a citrusy magnolia scent,"Growing up there were these huge, beautiful magnolia trees in my neighborhood that smelled so good and I‚Äôve been trying to find a scent that matches it for a long time. The magnolias where I grew up are more tropical, they‚Äôre the kind with large shiny waxy leaves and fat white flowers. They have more of a citrusy scent, not the powdery one you smell in magnolias that grow in colder climates.

I really enjoy the top notes of Magnolia Nobile by Acqua di Parma, but the dry down is very powdery/vanilla, which is not what I‚Äôm after. I‚Äôve also tried a lot of Chloe scents bc I know they‚Äôre supposed to have magnolia but those weren‚Äôt right either.

I  was not much of a perfume apprecitor until 5 or so years ago . I had the BBW an d the victorias secret perfumes, but no serious perfumes no REAL perfumes! 

My addiction started out by asking my husband for bottles of Juicy Couture and Angel for Xmas and he totally came through! This was the beginning of my excessive arm sniffing tendencies. 

The nest year i asked for Chanel N¬∞5 and received both the parfum and the eau de parfum as well, and I was in heaven.

I had run out of the CCM That I bought with my Xmas money last year as 5 bought the smallest bottle, telling myself I would conserve it( HA!!!! Maybe when hell freezes over) and my husband gifted me the whopping 3.4oz for my birthday! This is definitely my signature scent, and it took me years to figure that out! CCM is! chic and sophisticated and in a way it pulls .my whole look together and I feel a certain vibe of elegance even if I'm just wearing jeans and a tee shirt !

I was looking for some mini parfum versions from Serge Lutens. With some simple keywords from Google ([Link](https://www.google.com/search?q=serge+lutens+miniature+chergui&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enFR837FR837&amp;oq=serge+lutens+miniature+chergui&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3.7648j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)), I was directed straight forward to official Serge Luten website. However, these are surprisingly  0 EUR (Free).  I did some extra search and found out there were at least 4 of them with 0 EUR.

I'm a 22 yo guy, pretty tall, into sports like Parkour, the great outdoors, knives, metal-/woodworking and such. Not really the social type. Also not the guy to wear a suit. Long hair, never too serious, I think you get the picture. 
I really want to feel more comfortable around people, and one way I figured is to smell great!
Sadly, I have no clue what to look for in a nice perfume or even how to wear one.
Hence is why I'm here. 

I love smells like licorice, freshly dug up earth, vanilla, green tea and wood (that's a big one!).

I'd be very thankful for any and all recommendation, even if it's a completely different smell than what I've listed and you just think I should give it a go!

I think it smells like a wet dog that rolled around in some rotting seaweed and dead fish, and then wound up walking into a poorly cleaned up crime scene...a bloody one, and also rolled around in that. That is what the bottle should say. Allegedly it's supposed to smell like sex?! Not any kind of sex that I've ever had! It is one of the most revolting things I have EVER smelled and I cannot believe that some people would spend $100 to smell like that!

1605988054,Perfumes,Chanel Coco Noir - confusing!,"I'm having a really hard time deciding if I like this fragrance or not... It seems to get mixed reviews online, though mostly positive. I LOVE Chanel Coco which I own, and I have a sample of Coco Mademoiselle which I find very pleasantly sweet and youthful smelling (after the dry-down), though not necessarily ""me"". I prefer darker spicy floral oriental scents, so I figured Noir would be perfect.

I sprayed Coco Noir on my wrist last night. I find it... intriguing? It reminds me of Coco Mademoiselle more-so than my beloved Coco. The initial blast smells incredible and magical and spicy to me - almost unisex, then it goes into this ""sour"" citrusy mode for an hour or so. After that... it's pleasant floral and a little spicy/powdery, but nothing overpowering, yet this peachy note persists throughout. It's odd how it morphs over time, I've never owned a fragrance that had such noticeable transitions like this. 

My dilemma is that I can't tell if I like it or not? This scent is definitely a journey! I could do without the sourness in the first hour, it's a bit much. But after that it's kind of lovely. I don't know that I would refer to it as ""dark""? It is pleasant though as I find myself constantly smelling my wrist when I test it. I'm going to test it tonight when I see my boyfriend and see what he thinks...

What do you all think of this fragrance? Does anyone else have this same dilemma? Or do you know of other fragrances that behave this way?"
1606012120,Perfumes,Reccomend me your favourite summer holiday scents!,"TL;DR - Reccomend summery scents of coconut, pineapple, mango, suncream etc.

I'm not sure if this nostalgia lies within everyone since we all come from different places. I'm from the UK, and 'summer holidays' are a thing here. Basically when you and your family or friends fly to usually Spain, Portugal, Canary Islands etc and spend 2 weeks in the scorching sunüåû And personally, a huge part of summer nostalgia is the smell of suncream, pina coladas and just golden sunlight (I know that's not a smell but surely some of you will relate!)

I'm looking for any reccomend actions at all because I'd love to try out some new scents that have this vibe. I've already tried a couple, but I doubt I'll get tired of it and although lots of them contain the same scents, I find many to still smell different and interesting from eachother.

My favourite isn't a perfume but actually a scented moisturiser: Island Coconut Mango by The Fox Tan"
1606013215,Perfumes,Does anybody else feel their preference in scents doesn't 'suit' them?,"Just a random discussion because this is on my mind a lot!

I'm a female, 19 years old. The past 10 years or so of my school life, I've been surrounded by girls wearing super sweet and sickly scents as they spray their VS Lovespell body mist into the classroom for the 100th time. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy those scents too sometimes. I own VS Bombshell (and another small pink one I can't remember the name of!) however I do think that's one of their scents that is less sweet, more sultry and honestly, a bit masculine?

I also love floral and holiday type scents. However, my absolute favourite perfume is Vanderbilt. Which is a cheap perfume, less than ¬£10 so it's probably a dupe for something I'm not aware of. My problem is that although I love it, I feel like it gives off vibes of a typical 'granny' perfume? I never wear it to work because I'm afraid people will think it's an odd scent and too old for me. I know the correct answer is that I shouldn't care what people think, but I don't feel that's completely fair as I can usually never smell myself after 15 minutes but I sometimes get compliments hours later from other people, so if they're the ones smelling it then I don't want it to be weird! Although I'd rather smell of luxurious granny than of something that's actually bad, lol.

Any other experiences like this? :("

1606077455,Perfumes,Please help!,"My mother passed away in 2008. I kept her perfume that she wore the most and reminded me of her. Don't ask me why but when I moved out of my dad's house 6 years ago I didn't bring it with me. I thought it would be safe but my dad just told me that he cleaned out my old room a few months ago and threw everything away.

I can't really remember the scent but it was a perfume that came out earlier than the fall of 2008 (when she passed). If I had to guess I'd say she bought it 2006 or before. The bottle was clear and a hexagon shape but if the hexagon was squished down and elongated along the x-axis with rounded corners. The cap was spiraled and came to a point and was fairly large compared to the size of the bottle. The perfume itself was clear or a very light amber color. Most likely under about $150 as I cant see her having spent too much money on it.

I am sorry if my description is awful but I am kind of desperate to find the perfume again! Any help would be appreciated!!"

L'Oreal has cheapen out the whole Maison Lancome line by pretty much destroying the original design of the bottles (2 gold plaques, one with the name and assemblage, the other one with the flowers). Instead, they only kept 1 gold plaque with the perfume name and the flowers on the same side. 

I'm so frustrated over this change. The bottles were one of the reasons why I loved this line; it gave me joy to look at them. I am testing the perfume now to see if they have reformulated Jasmins Marzipane or Oud Bouquet. It would piss me off even further if they really did that."

1606614435,Perfumes,Please help me replace my favorite discontinued perfume!,"Hello! Longtime lurker on this subreddit and first-time poster.  Years ago, I bought a small perfume called ""Aquarius"" at a Miniso store in Bangalore, India. It was cheap, part of a display of other Zodiac-themed fragrances, but the scent is surprisingly \*beautiful\* - elegant, musky, sensual, aquatic... and LIMITED!  It went out of production and seems to be unavailable worldwide, except in the philippines. 

I have a teeny tiny amount left in the bottle that I dare not use because I may never smell it again.. Please, perfume reddit! How do I find out what this magical fragrance is??

The only notes listed on the Miniso website are ""citrus"" and ""floral."" The back label of the bottle says ""a bright, watery scent."" I've spent years trying to buy perfumes that I think sound similar, but nothing smells remotely close. 

At this point, I'm even willing to offer a reward to anyone who can get me more - or identify a replacement. Please help! Thanks!"

I was at work when this lady walked past me and she had on this most amazing vanilla based fragrance on. I felt too weird at the time to ask her what she was wearing but now I deeply regret it. I was just wondering if anyone could recommend something. Vanilla was definitely the main note in the fragrance accompanied by a citrus note (perhaps bergamot) and possibly ylang ylang. It wasn‚Äôt a complex scent but it smelt equally clean and gourmand. Sort of a creamy vanilla but not overly sweet. I think it would definitely fall in the ‚Äúoriental‚Äù family of perfumes. It also seemed to have no or very little sandalwood, amber, or musk (which I dislike too much of any of those). I love vanilla based perfumes and I have tried quite a few but I can‚Äôt find a match. :/ probably the closest one I have found has been Creed‚Äôs Vanille Sublime.

I'm talking about the ones such as Eau de Monsieur, and Eau de Sud,, and the others in the ridged barrel shaped bottles with the huge grand lids. Not the more modern range - it doesn't apply to those atall.

Every time I wear one I'm reminded of a time when I was a kid and a senior lady of the neighbourhood was showing me around her greenhouse full of tomato plants.

1601891029,Perfumes,Help on Finding a Discontinued Killian Perfume,"Hello! About two years ago I dug up an atomizer sample of this perfume by Killian that I LOVED. It was the perfect girly and delicate scent. It had notes of peach and smelled a little powdery. It was the perfect mix between fruity and powdery and it was a very soft scent. I went to Saks to see if I could figure out what it was. This is where I learned the name of the fragrance and that it was sadly discontinued. I don't think it had great reviews which might be why they discontinued it. I'm not much of a perfume wearer so I didn't pursue it further and I ended up forgetting the name of it :( When I tried googling ""peach powder Killian discontinued"" the only thing that came up was flower of immortality. I'm not a fan of that scent. I wanted to see if anyone could help me figure out what this fragrance might be! I've started wearing fragrance now and this is (or was) my perfect scent. :) I'm hoping that if I figure out what it was called, that I could find some good dupe fragrances out there. Thanks!"

1601918547,Perfumes,Helping finding autumnal scent,"Hi there. I hope some of you can assist.

Im not one for expensive perfumes and I don't very often wear them now that I'm mostly at home, but as autumn has arrived I've been feeling very inspired to try and find a perfect autumnal fragrance to boost my mood and feed my love of all things autumn, earthy and a teensy bit goth. 

My favourite scent is patchouli, and I used to love the solid perfumes from lush before they started using whatever it is that leaves a garish orange stain on the skin. The only other perfumes I loved were Givenchy Very Irr√©sistible and Bulgari Jasmine Noir.

To me, autumn smells like spices, patchouli, wood, moss and burning leaves. I really want something earthy and dark. Can anyone recommend any specific perfumes or point me in the right direction?

Appreciate this might be a slightly odd request. I am hoping that this exists somewhere out there and I'm just unaware!

Thanks so much."

I have seen many posts about obtaining the skill to identify different notes in perfumes. But I have a slightly related yet different question. 
Namely, one of my favorite perfumes ever is Tresor La Nuit and I know it‚Äôs labeled as a really sweet perfume but I simply can‚Äôt pick up the sweet notes in it. I actually realized it‚Äôs gourmand/sweet when my friend said I smell like cupcakes lol. 
What I actually like about Tresor LN is a certain sharpness it has, and barely/rarely sense the sweetness. 


I don‚Äôt think this has happened to me with another perfume, I am usually great at picking up and identifying the different notes so I was wondering, has something like this happened to anyone too?

Production Date:  2017-04 

I've been loyal to Armani Code for around 8 - 9 years already and I recently bought a new bottle. The seller said it was Authentic Tester and the whole presentation of the product seems legitimate. However, I noticed that its scent is quite different. The citrus note became more powerful and the leathery and tobacco notes seemed toned down. The original fragrance scent came from full-bodied into this presently light and fresh citrus. Its classiness worn off and now smells like something I would wear in a beach. Its originally 'sweet' aroma became 'sour'. Its well-rounded edges suddenly became sharp. It also smells like more diluted. Additionally, it has a decreased longevity and projection. Any of you had any experience same as mine? Or do you think I carelessly bought a fake one?"

 I guess most answers may be ""go to a shop and test them"" however i wanted to gain from insight from you guys to see if anyone had any other advice as its for a Christmas present. 

We are both 23, however he is very much an old man personality wise, he even usually dresses in a style much older than he is. 

Whereas most guys locally our age are in fancy trainers, skinny jeans and tight tops. My BF is often found in straight cut Levi's, a chequered shirt and brown chuck-boots.

I am looking to buy him a parfum for Christmas, up to ¬£100. Which would fit his older man style, he doesn't like fruity or citrus scents and needs something woody or tobacco smelling, something older and  manly. 

He hasn't had one since i have known him, but has asked for one for Christmas but not given me any brands or anything.

Does anyone have any recommendations, anyone use anything similar to this?"

But this one supposedly just came out, and the ""L'occitane Rose"" that looks very similar looks like it came out in 2018. I don't know what to do anymore as I have already spent so much time trying to find it, and asking her if she remembers which one it is constantly, lol. Maybe somebody has some extra information or something, or I just have to buy all the types of rose until I get the right one. I really want to smell it on her again like I did that very first day.

I am thinking about Narciso Rodriguez For Her (the black rectangle bottle)/Poudr√©e/White Musc/Narciso (cubes, but definitely not the red one). How sweet NR fragrances are? 

I used l'Occitane La Terre de Lumi√®re because got it for Christmas. It was okay but I find it a bit too sweet. I liked the honey note though, it's so warming and the dryout is beautiful. Elie Saab Girl of Now - way too sweet for my taste. So cloying and sweet, the scent is annoying. Elizabeth Arden - White Tea - headache inducing. There are notes that clash with each other. I don't want to smell like roses. Something sexy enough but also safe for everyday wear. Something subtle."

 **1. After Shower:** Your skin absorbs perfume better when it is warm.

**2. Hydrate your Skin:** Apply moisturizer before applying perfume. It protects the skin from chemicals and also helps the perfume to stay on the surface longer.¬†

**3.** **Hold fragrance away from your body:** The distance should be at least 5-7 inches away from the body.

**4. Apply on the pulse points:**¬†Spray perfume onto your ‚Äúpulse points.‚Äù like Behind earlobes, on the neck, on wrists, elbows, etc.

**Pro Tip:** Don‚Äôt rub after apply fragrance, it will fade away the fragrance very soon. Let it dry itself.?"

1604932013,Perfumes,Looking for a citrusy magnolia scent,"Growing up there were these huge, beautiful magnolia trees in my neighborhood that smelled so good and I‚Äôve been trying to find a scent that matches it for a long time. The magnolias where I grew up are more tropical, they‚Äôre the kind with large shiny waxy leaves and fat white flowers. They have more of a citrusy scent, not the powdery one you smell in magnolias that grow in colder climates.

I really enjoy the top notes of Magnolia Nobile by Acqua di Parma, but the dry down is very powdery/vanilla, which is not what I‚Äôm after. I‚Äôve also tried a lot of Chloe scents bc I know they‚Äôre supposed to have magnolia but those weren‚Äôt right either.

I really love scents like grapefruit, lemon, orange, musk, freesia and ylang ylang. I love clean scents as well.

I  was not much of a perfume apprecitor until 5 or so years ago . I had the BBW an d the victorias secret perfumes, but no serious perfumes no REAL perfumes! 

My addiction started out by asking my husband for bottles of Juicy Couture and Angel for Xmas and he totally came through! This was the beginning of my excessive arm sniffing tendencies. 

The nest year i asked for Chanel N¬∞5 and received both the parfum and the eau de parfum as well, and I was in heaven.

I had run out of the CCM That I bought with my Xmas money last year as 5 bought the smallest bottle, telling myself I would conserve it( HA!!!! Maybe when hell freezes over) and my husband gifted me the whopping 3.4oz for my birthday! This is definitely my signature scent, and it took me years to figure that out! CCM is! chic and sophisticated and in a way it pulls .my whole look together and I feel a certain vibe of elegance even if I'm just wearing jeans and a tee shirt !

I was looking for some mini parfum versions from Serge Lutens.

However, these are surprisingly  0 EUR (Free).  I did some extra search and found out there were at least 4 of them with 0 EUR.

So they don‚Äôt make this perfume any more I don‚Äôt think, last year Dior re-launched the EDT version of the line and changed the notes a bit.

The whole Miss Dior collection has changed a lot over the years, back 2011 I‚Äôm sure it was a lot different than past versions as well! So for those of you guys who like Miss Dior, which is your favorite version or year?

As far as I know personality, occasion and looks play an important role in selection so here is some important information I guess. 

I am a rather laid back male with short dark brown hair, dark brown eyes, a short trimmed beard, 5'6'' tall, not buff but definitely have an athletic build. I usually wear dark colors such as black, dark blue and rosewood, burgundy etc with dark-grey or black pants and your average nike sneakers. I like doing sports, smoking cigars, guns, cars and playing video games. I am a rather quiet person since I am an introvert. My music taste ranges from gypsy jazz all the way to futuresynth. I love wearing suits but never get the chance to wear one since I still attend a technical University and it would be hella weird being the only student who is dressed like that.   


I hope some of ya'll are able to recommend perfumes that could suit me! I am open to all kinds of smells but personally I prefer rather leathery, woodish, tabacco-ish scents. Thank you!"

1597916042,Perfumes,Are fragrance notes typically synthetic these days? Asking for my cat.,"I‚Äôm looking at a couple of perfumes that have key notes of lily of the valley, and the actual plant is potentially deadly to cats. Which got me wondering if commercially available perfumes with scents of plants that are toxic to pets contain anything of the plant that pets could react with, or if they‚Äôre low enough concentration and/or synthetic so it‚Äôs not a big deal. Real lilies, for instance, should never be around cats because even the pollen can shut down their kidneys pretty quickly (lily of the valley has to be ingested and causes heart problems). I‚Äôm not sure if the scents contain anything that is an issue since most plants have to be ingested in some way to start the reaction. That would be pretty easy though if my cat rubbed against me and then licked his fur. 

Probably a silly question but I‚Äôm paranoid lol I stopped using essential oils for scent in my home when I got my cat because they‚Äôre so concentrated that many of them can‚Äôt be processed by cats‚Äô little bodies. Fragrance in general can be harmful to cats‚Äô lungs, though I don‚Äôt really wear a lot when I‚Äôm just at home. I don‚Äôt want to harm my kitty just to smell good. 

I can ask on a cat/vet sub, but figured people here would know more about what goes into perfume and how it‚Äôs made, whereas a lot of vets wouldn‚Äôt have any idea. 

I‚Äôm specifically looking at Maison Margiela REPLICA Lazy Sunday Morning (lily of the valley) and Springtime in the Park (lily of the valley accord). Thanks!"

1598369608,Perfumes,Boutique Stores,"Hello all. 

If redditors are looking for a fragrance and don't know where to start, might I suggest looking into whether the city you live in has a boutique perfume store. Not only could these small businesses use your business right now, they usually sell sample sizes and ship so you can try out fragrances before buying full bottles. Boutiques also carry niche fragrances that bigger retailers do not carry, so you can find something that feels different, rare, and personally chosen. It can be overwhelming the sheer amount of fragrances these stores offer sometimes, but that's part of the fun. 

Even if you don't live in a major city, go onto google maps and type in perfume store in the nearest big city and see what pops up. If you live near New York, there's Aedes, Twisted Lily, Fragrance Shop, for example. 

Good luck on your scent journey!"
1598476100,Perfumes,Perfume label illegal?,"I make homemade perfumes out of natural and synthetic fragrance oils. I want to sell them online, but have come to a bump in the road. I‚Äôm using those little 10ml roller bottles and a small box to fit them in, which makes it hard to fit information on such a small space. It‚Äôs my understanding that you need warnings, ingredients, directs, name and place of business, etc on the inner AND outer label, and yet, I see professional INNER labels (on perfumes sold in big stores)  with none of that information. All they have is the name of the scent and company name. How is this legal? Is my understanding of labeling perfume wrong?"

I found myself in need of a great fragrance while in a pinch! I am setting my hopes into buying Tom Fords Black Orchid someday soon (kind of pricey for me right now) but for the meantime, I must settle on something else to do the job.

While shopping around a retail store, I just so happen to find a 1.0 ml bottle of Midnight Shimmer by Micheal Kors.

For the price of $20, being an EDP, and MK branded, I decided to look into what it smelled like.
It was described as Oriental and my mind quickly reverted back to the initial scent I‚Äôve always wanted to experience - Black Orchid.

Only thing was, was that it is branded as a WOMENS scent. (I found it amongst other perfumes in the men‚Äôs section) 

So, that leads me back to my question as mentioned in the title: Could this scent POSSIBLY pass being worn by a male?

Oh, forgot to mention that I picked it up either way, but I don‚Äôt want to try it out because said retail store doesn‚Äôt refund used items, so if it really is just a women‚Äôs scent, I can get my money back and get something else.

Thanks for any input in advance! Thank you!"

I was at work when this lady walked past me and she had on this most amazing vanilla based fragrance on. I felt too weird at the time to ask her what she was wearing but now I deeply regret it. I was just wondering if anyone could recommend something. Vanilla was definitely the main note in the fragrance accompanied by a citrus note (perhaps bergamot) and possibly ylang ylang. It wasn‚Äôt a complex scent but it smelt equally clean and gourmand. Sort of a creamy vanilla but not overly sweet. I think it would definitely fall in the ‚Äúoriental‚Äù family of perfumes. It also seemed to have no or very little sandalwood, amber, or musk (which I dislike too much of any of those). I love vanilla based perfumes and I have tried quite a few but I can‚Äôt find a match. :/ probably the closest one I have found has been Creed‚Äôs Vanille Sublime. Perhaps one of you has suggestions? 
These are the perfumes that can be ruled out since I already own or have tested them:
Aerin Tangier Vanille
Calvin Klein Obsession
Dior Addict 
Mon Guerlain

I can only smell the bigger picture of the scent, but I cannot separate each note from the other. Do you guys have any suggestions as to how I can improve my skill in analyzing and deconstructing perfumes?"

I'm talking about the ones such as Eau de Monsieur, and Eau de Sud,, and the others in the ridged barrel shaped bottles with the huge grand lids. Not the more modern range - it doesn't apply to those atall.

Every time I wear one I'm reminded of a time when I was a kid and a senior lady of the neighbourhood was showing me around her greenhouse full of tomato plants.

1601891029,Perfumes,Help on Finding a Discontinued Killian Perfume,"Hello! About two years ago I dug up an atomizer sample of this perfume by Killian that I LOVED. It was the perfect girly and delicate scent. It had notes of peach and smelled a little powdery. It was the perfect mix between fruity and powdery and it was a very soft scent. I went to Saks to see if I could figure out what it was. This is where I learned the name of the fragrance and that it was sadly discontinued. I don't think it had great reviews which might be why they discontinued it. I'm not much of a perfume wearer so I didn't pursue it further and I ended up forgetting the name of it :( When I tried googling ""peach powder Killian discontinued"" the only thing that came up was flower of immortality. I'm not a fan of that scent. I wanted to see if anyone could help me figure out what this fragrance might be! I've started wearing fragrance now and this is (or was) my perfect scent. :) I'm hoping that if I figure out what it was called, that I could find some good dupe fragrances out there. Thanks!"

1601918547,Perfumes,Helping finding autumnal scent,"Hi there. I hope some of you can assist.

Im not one for expensive perfumes and I don't very often wear them now that I'm mostly at home, but as autumn has arrived I've been feeling very inspired to try and find a perfect autumnal fragrance to boost my mood and feed my love of all things autumn, earthy and a teensy bit goth. 

My favourite scent is patchouli, and I used to love the solid perfumes from lush before they started using whatever it is that leaves a garish orange stain on the skin. The only other perfumes I loved were Givenchy Very Irr√©sistible and Bulgari Jasmine Noir.

To me, autumn smells like spices, patchouli, wood, moss and burning leaves. I really want something earthy and dark. Can anyone recommend any specific perfumes or point me in the right direction?

Appreciate this might be a slightly odd request. I am hoping that this exists somewhere out there and I'm just unaware!

Thanks so much."

I have seen many posts about obtaining the skill to identify different notes in perfumes. But I have a slightly related yet different question. 
Namely, one of my favorite perfumes ever is Tresor La Nuit and I know it‚Äôs labeled as a really sweet perfume but I simply can‚Äôt pick up the sweet notes in it. I actually realized it‚Äôs gourmand/sweet when my friend said I smell like cupcakes lol. 
What I actually like about Tresor LN is a certain sharpness it has, and barely/rarely sense the sweetness. 


I don‚Äôt think this has happened to me with another perfume, I am usually great at picking up and identifying the different notes so I was wondering, has something like this happened to anyone too?

Production Date:  2017-04 

I've been loyal to Armani Code for around 8 - 9 years already and I recently bought a new bottle. The seller said it was Authentic Tester and the whole presentation of the product seems legitimate. However, I noticed that its scent is quite different. The citrus note became more powerful and the leathery and tobacco notes seemed toned down. The original fragrance scent came from full-bodied into this presently light and fresh citrus. Its classiness worn off and now smells like something I would wear in a beach. Its originally 'sweet' aroma became 'sour'. Its well-rounded edges suddenly became sharp. It also smells like more diluted. Additionally, it has a decreased longevity and projection. Any of you had any experience same as mine? Or do you think I carelessly bought a fake one?"

 I guess most answers may be ""go to a shop and test them"" however i wanted to gain from insight from you guys to see if anyone had any other advice as its for a Christmas present. 

We are both 23, however he is very much an old man personality wise, he even usually dresses in a style much older than he is. 

Whereas most guys locally our age are in fancy trainers, skinny jeans and tight tops. My BF is often found in straight cut Levi's, a chequered shirt and brown chuck-boots.

I am looking to buy him a parfum for Christmas, up to ¬£100. Which would fit his older man style, he doesn't like fruity or citrus scents and needs something woody or tobacco smelling, something older and  manly. 

He hasn't had one since i have known him, but has asked for one for Christmas but not given me any brands or anything.

Does anyone have any recommendations, anyone use anything similar to this?"

I don't know what to do anymore as I have already spent so much time trying to find it, and asking her if she remembers which one it is constantly, lol. Maybe somebody has some extra information or something, or I just have to buy all the types of rose until I get the right one. I really want to smell it on her again like I did that very first day.

On my first date with my now called wife I got this Gucci perfume, this was almost 10 years ago and I absolutely love it and refuse to spray it on a non special day.

I have a small collection of perfume thanks to my wife, but nothing compares to this scent.

My question is if a discontinued scent will ever be brought back to life? I have received a new scent from Dior yesterday called Fahrenheit and while it is a very nice perfume I began to question if this is the best that's left of my first experience of a good perfume.

My wife also has this Dior perfume called midnight poison (blue) and she keeps it close to her and doesn't want to finish it. 

So basically does a discontinued perfume ever come back?"

Hard to explain but it smells like a fluffy warm creamy cloud to me, probably because of the whipped cream note), and Carolina Herrera Good Girl (I liked it but it was a little bit strong for me and not as smooth or floral as I like). I haven‚Äôt had a chance to try Good Girl Legere which I heard is more floral and less heavy on the cacao. I didn‚Äôt realize I loved tuberose until recently. On my list to try: Frederic Malle Carnal Flower, by Kilian Beyond Love, Le Labo Lys 41, Robert Piquet Fracas, Rogue Perfumery Champs Lunaires, Gucci Bloom, Hermes Twilly, Good Girl Legere, Tom Ford Orchid Soleil, McQueen EDP, Solstice Scents Nightgown (heard this one smells like the Amouage!).. any other recommendations?

Jasmine- my favorite that I‚Äôve tried is definitely Van Cleef &amp; Arpels California Reverie, but I haven‚Äôt tried many jasmine dominant fragrances. Mugler Alien seems like it would be perfect based on the notes in it but something about it smells very harsh to me and gives me an instance headache, which is so disappointing!

Orange blossom- I love Parfums de Marly Safanad! Many people like Love by Kilian but it‚Äôs very strong on the marshmallow note and not floral enough for me. I think Safanad is so much better and more pleasant if you found Love too sweet. I also have Memo Paris Granada, which is so beautiful but unfortunately is a bit too heavy for me and tends to give me a headache. Something about it reminds me of Alien but it‚Äôs much nicer in my opinion. I haven‚Äôt tried that many orange blossom fragrances so I‚Äôd love to hear your recommendations. 

I love plumeria but I haven‚Äôt had the chance to try any plumeria perfumes, but on my list to try are Annick Goutal Songes and Chantecaille Frangipane."

Where I am, many places aren‚Äôt open just yet but even if they were, i don‚Äôt feel quite safe venturing out with California surging as badly as it is.

Coco Mademoiselle
Serge Lutens Datura Noir

Tom Ford Jasmin Rouge
Diptyque Eau Duelle
Maison Margiela Beach Walk

The last three I‚Äôve owned but felt silage was weak, so I don‚Äôt feel I can buy them again.

It was my first nice perfume so I basically only wore it out to nice occasions. I still only wear it for select reasons and the bottle has a little more than half left. So they don‚Äôt make this perfume any more I don‚Äôt think, last year Dior re-launched the EDT version of the line and changed the notes a bit. I tested it in the store a while back and it smells much sweeter now, more like the new version of the EDP that has been out for a while. I like it, it‚Äôs totally not the same fragrance though. The whole Miss Dior collection has changed a lot over the years, back 2011 I‚Äôm sure it was a lot different than past versions as well! So for those of you guys who like Miss Dior, which is your favorite version or year?

As far as I know personality, occasion and looks play an important role in selection so here is some important information I guess. 

I am a rather laid back male with short dark brown hair, dark brown eyes, a short trimmed beard, 5'6'' tall, not buff but definitely have an athletic build. I usually wear dark colors such as black, dark blue and rosewood, burgundy etc with dark-grey or black pants and your average nike sneakers. I like doing sports, smoking cigars, guns, cars and playing video games. I am a rather quiet person since I am an introvert. My music taste ranges from gypsy jazz all the way to futuresynth. I love wearing suits but never get the chance to wear one since I still attend a technical University and it would be hella weird being the only student who is dressed like that.   


I hope some of ya'll are able to recommend perfumes that could suit me! I am open to all kinds of smells but personally I prefer rather leathery, woodish, tabacco-ish scents. Thank you!"

1597916042,Perfumes,Are fragrance notes typically synthetic these days? Asking for my cat.,"I‚Äôm looking at a couple of perfumes that have key notes of lily of the valley, and the actual plant is potentially deadly to cats. Which got me wondering if commercially available perfumes with scents of plants that are toxic to pets contain anything of the plant that pets could react with, or if they‚Äôre low enough concentration and/or synthetic so it‚Äôs not a big deal. Real lilies, for instance, should never be around cats because even the pollen can shut down their kidneys pretty quickly (lily of the valley has to be ingested and causes heart problems). I‚Äôm not sure if the scents contain anything that is an issue since most plants have to be ingested in some way to start the reaction. That would be pretty easy though if my cat rubbed against me and then licked his fur. 

Probably a silly question but I‚Äôm paranoid lol I stopped using essential oils for scent in my home when I got my cat because they‚Äôre so concentrated that many of them can‚Äôt be processed by cats‚Äô little bodies. Fragrance in general can be harmful to cats‚Äô lungs, though I don‚Äôt really wear a lot when I‚Äôm just at home. I don‚Äôt want to harm my kitty just to smell good. 

I can ask on a cat/vet sub, but figured people here would know more about what goes into perfume and how it‚Äôs made, whereas a lot of vets wouldn‚Äôt have any idea. 

I‚Äôm specifically looking at Maison Margiela REPLICA Lazy Sunday Morning (lily of the valley) and Springtime in the Park (lily of the valley accord). Thanks!"

1598369608,Perfumes,Boutique Stores,"Hello all. 

If redditors are looking for a fragrance and don't know where to start, might I suggest looking into whether the city you live in has a boutique perfume store. Not only could these small businesses use your business right now, they usually sell sample sizes and ship so you can try out fragrances before buying full bottles. Boutiques also carry niche fragrances that bigger retailers do not carry, so you can find something that feels different, rare, and personally chosen. It can be overwhelming the sheer amount of fragrances these stores offer sometimes, but that's part of the fun. 

Even if you don't live in a major city, go onto google maps and type in perfume store in the nearest big city and see what pops up. If you live near New York, there's Aedes, Twisted Lily, Fragrance Shop, for example. 

Good luck on your scent journey!"

I found myself in need of a great fragrance while in a pinch! I am setting my hopes into buying Tom Fords Black Orchid someday soon (kind of pricey for me right now) but for the meantime, I must settle on something else to do the job.

While shopping around a retail store, I just so happen to find a 1.0 ml bottle of Midnight Shimmer by Micheal Kors.

For the price of $20, being an EDP, and MK branded, I decided to look into what it smelled like.
It was described as Oriental and my mind quickly reverted back to the initial scent I‚Äôve always wanted to experience - Black Orchid.

Only thing was, was that it is branded as a WOMENS scent. (I found it amongst other perfumes in the men‚Äôs section) 

So, that leads me back to my question as mentioned in the title: Could this scent POSSIBLY pass being worn by a male?

Oh, forgot to mention that I picked it up either way, but I don‚Äôt want to try it out because said retail store doesn‚Äôt refund used items, so if it really is just a women‚Äôs scent, I can get my money back and get something else.

Thanks for any input in advance! Thank you!"

1599224158,Perfumes,Hunt for a vanilla perfume,"Hello! I have been looking for a certain vanilla perfume. I was at work when this lady walked past me and she had on this most amazing vanilla based fragrance on. I felt too weird at the time to ask her what she was wearing but now I deeply regret it. I was just wondering if anyone could recommend something. Vanilla was definitely the main note in the fragrance accompanied by a citrus note (perhaps bergamot) and possibly ylang ylang. It wasn‚Äôt a complex scent but it smelt equally clean and gourmand. Sort of a creamy vanilla but not overly sweet. I think it would definitely fall in the ‚Äúoriental‚Äù family of perfumes. It also seemed to have no or very little sandalwood, amber, or musk (which I dislike too much of any of those). I love vanilla based perfumes and I have tried quite a few but I can‚Äôt find a match. :/ probably the closest one I have found has been Creed‚Äôs Vanille Sublime. Perhaps one of you has suggestions? 
These are the perfumes that can be ruled out since I already own or have tested them:
Aerin Tangier Vanille
Calvin Klein Obsession
Dior Addict 
Mon Guerlain 
Creed Vanille Sublime 
Laura Mercier Vanilla body sprays 
Louis Vuitton Contre Moi

1592997406,Perfumes,What do you value in your perfume the most?,"Hello, after a lot of research and planning I've decided to start my own perfume brand, I've had a lot of perfumes in my life and always loved them which makes me very passionate about my product and the person recieving it. But in order for me to create the best experience I need some imput from my target demographic. Therefore this question: ""what do you value from your perfumes?"". This might of course be a select smell but also a little thing that stood out from all the other perfumes, like Nice packaging or a little extra that came with the perfume itself. I would really appreciate some feedback on which perfume you liked the most and what made it so special.
Thanks a lot in advance (:"
1593099623,Perfumes,Beginner looking for gourmand scents!,"Hello!

I've recently developed an interest in perfumes, and am interested in expanding my (very very small) collection. I've found that my tastes in perfune fit my career choice as a confectioner, anf I absolutley love gourmand scents. (Soft, white florals come in second place!) My absolute favorite notes are vanilla, sugar, and caramel. I like to smell like dessert!

I've bought two very basic gourmand scents this far, those being Pink Sugar and Prada Candy Gloss. Pink Sugar is by far my favorite despite being cheap. I think it smells like a soft, dreamy cotton candy cloud. Prada Candy Gloss seems divisive, but I think that it smells beautifully fresh, and do not at all get the ""cough syrup"" smell that some people have complained about.  I was also gifted a bottle of Black Opium by my father, but I didn't like the scent on me very much. I think it was the coffee that threw me off. I seem to prefer things that are girly and sugary rather than mature and a little bitter. 

I'd really love any recommendations for your favorite gourmand perfumes, prefferably leaning in the desserty direction! Anything vanillary, chocolatey, sugary, or caramelly goes! 

Thank you ‚ù§"

I have a small collection of perfume thanks to my wife, but nothing compares to this scent.

My question is if a discontinued scent will ever be brought back to life? I have received a new scent from Dior yesterday called Fahrenheit and while it is a very nice perfume I began to question if this is the best that's left of my first experience of a good perfume.

My wife also has this Dior perfume called midnight poison (blue) and she keeps it close to her and doesn't want to finish it.

1596427282,Perfumes,What are your favorite white floral fragrances?,"For tuberose, I‚Äôve tried Diptyque Do Son (love it, it‚Äôs so pretty, fresh, and natural), Amouage Love Tuberose (amazing!! Hard to explain but it smells like a fluffy warm creamy cloud to me, probably because of the whipped cream note), and Carolina Herrera Good Girl (I liked it but it was a little bit strong for me and not as smooth or floral as I like). I haven‚Äôt had a chance to try Good Girl Legere which I heard is more floral and less heavy on the cacao. I didn‚Äôt realize I loved tuberose until recently. On my list to try: Frederic Malle Carnal Flower, by Kilian Beyond Love, Le Labo Lys 41, Robert Piquet Fracas, Rogue Perfumery Champs Lunaires, Gucci Bloom, Hermes Twilly, Good Girl Legere, Tom Ford Orchid Soleil, McQueen EDP, Solstice Scents Nightgown (heard this one smells like the Amouage!).. any other recommendations?

Jasmine- my favorite that I‚Äôve tried is definitely Van Cleef &amp; Arpels California Reverie, but I haven‚Äôt tried many jasmine dominant fragrances. Mugler Alien seems like it would be perfect based on the notes in it but something about it smells very harsh to me and gives me an instance headache, which is so disappointing!

Orange blossom- I love Parfums de Marly Safanad! Many people like Love by Kilian but it‚Äôs very strong on the marshmallow note and not floral enough for me. I think Safanad is so much better and more pleasant if you found Love too sweet. I also have Memo Paris Granada, which is so beautiful but unfortunately is a bit too heavy for me and tends to give me a headache. Something about it reminds me of Alien but it‚Äôs much nicer in my opinion. I haven‚Äôt tried that many orange blossom fragrances so I‚Äôd love to hear your recommendations. 

I love plumeria but I haven‚Äôt had the chance to try any plumeria perfumes, but on my list to try are Annick Goutal Songes and Chantecaille Frangipane."

Where I am, many places aren‚Äôt open just yet but even if they were, i don‚Äôt feel quite safe venturing out with California surging as badly as it is. I was hoping to crowd source recommendations based on some of what I like to find samples online and make an informed purchase. 

I have always loved a floriental or white floral fragrance. Some that I‚Äôve owned and enjoyed to varying degrees:
Coco Mademoiselle
Serge Lutens Datura Noir
Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab Snow White

I‚Äôve also loved the idea of:
Tom Ford Jasmin Rouge
Diptyque Eau Duelle
Maison Margiela Beach Walk

The last three I‚Äôve owned but felt silage was weak, so I don‚Äôt feel I can buy them again. I find I love white tropical notes (lush jasmine) or warmer notes (saffron, deep vanilla or even coconut without veering into sunscreen territory). Two dream fragrances were Killian Imperial Tea and Jo Malone Saffron but they were sadly discontinued when I wanted to buy them.

So they don‚Äôt make this perfume any more I don‚Äôt think, last year Dior re-launched the EDT version of the line and changed the notes a bit. I tested it in the store a while back and it smells much sweeter now, more like the new version of the EDP that has been out for a while. I like it, it‚Äôs totally not the same fragrance though. The whole Miss Dior collection has changed a lot over the years, back 2011 I‚Äôm sure it was a lot different than past versions as well!

As far as I know personality, occasion and looks play an important role in selection so here is some important information I guess. 

I am a rather laid back male with short dark brown hair, dark brown eyes, a short trimmed beard, 5'6'' tall, not buff but definitely have an athletic build. I usually wear dark colors such as black, dark blue and rosewood, burgundy etc with dark-grey or black pants and your average nike sneakers. I like doing sports, smoking cigars, guns, cars and playing video games. I am a rather quiet person since I am an introvert. My music taste ranges from gypsy jazz all the way to futuresynth. I love wearing suits but never get the chance to wear one since I still attend a technical University and it would be hella weird being the only student who is dressed like that.   


I hope some of ya'll are able to recommend perfumes that could suit me! I am open to all kinds of smells but personally I prefer rather leathery, woodish, tabacco-ish scents. Thank you!"

1597916042,Perfumes,Are fragrance notes typically synthetic these days? Asking for my cat.,"I‚Äôm looking at a couple of perfumes that have key notes of lily of the valley, and the actual plant is potentially deadly to cats. Which got me wondering if commercially available perfumes with scents of plants that are toxic to pets contain anything of the plant that pets could react with, or if they‚Äôre low enough concentration and/or synthetic so it‚Äôs not a big deal. Real lilies, for instance, should never be around cats because even the pollen can shut down their kidneys pretty quickly (lily of the valley has to be ingested and causes heart problems). I‚Äôm not sure if the scents contain anything that is an issue since most plants have to be ingested in some way to start the reaction. That would be pretty easy though if my cat rubbed against me and then licked his fur. 

Probably a silly question but I‚Äôm paranoid lol I stopped using essential oils for scent in my home when I got my cat because they‚Äôre so concentrated that many of them can‚Äôt be processed by cats‚Äô little bodies. Fragrance in general can be harmful to cats‚Äô lungs, though I don‚Äôt really wear a lot when I‚Äôm just at home. I don‚Äôt want to harm my kitty just to smell good. 

I can ask on a cat/vet sub, but figured people here would know more about what goes into perfume and how it‚Äôs made, whereas a lot of vets wouldn‚Äôt have any idea.

1598369608,Perfumes,Boutique Stores,"Hello all. 

If redditors are looking for a fragrance and don't know where to start, might I suggest looking into whether the city you live in has a boutique perfume store. Not only could these small businesses use your business right now, they usually sell sample sizes and ship so you can try out fragrances before buying full bottles. Boutiques also carry niche fragrances that bigger retailers do not carry, so you can find something that feels different, rare, and personally chosen. It can be overwhelming the sheer amount of fragrances these stores offer sometimes, but that's part of the fun. 

Even if you don't live in a major city, go onto google maps and type in perfume store in the nearest big city and see what pops up. If you live near New York, there's Aedes, Twisted Lily, Fragrance Shop, for example. 

Good luck on your scent journey!"

1589047452,Perfumes,Rochas Femme vs Rochas Femme 2013,"Hi.  So I've heard a lot about Rochas Femme, a fruity chypre that's  basically the stuff of legends. Found it on sale on Notino for quite  cheap ($40ish/‚Ç¨32ish), though I have never smelled it before. Still, I  love chypre as a genre (adore Mitsouko, Diaghilev, Amouage Fate,  Jubilation), and this being what could be considered a reference  fragrance, I am highly considering buying it.

However,  there's the issue of formulation. Notino's offering both what seems to  be the original (it's just labelled ""Rochas Femme"") *and*  ""Rochas Femme 2013"". It's weird to me that Notino would actually sell  vintage fragrances (they don't usually do that afaik), and the official  Rochas website doesn't tell me much, so I'm a bit confused.

Does  anyone have experience with this fragrance? What could you tell me  about it (old version vs. new version etc.)? Also, what's your take on  the Notino thing? Would it actually be possible that they're selling a  vintage bottle? Thanks"

I forgot how much this bottle costs so I looked it up again. Now it's no where. I keep rephrasing my search words time and time again and I'm seeing no results. I find results for other S&amp;C fragrances but not Star even though I it's been featured on google and fragrance sites before. Is there a reason why this fragrance just vanished out of sight?

I've had the pleasure of getting a sample of Confessions of a Garden Gnome, by Fort &amp; Manle, and I actually fell head over heels in love with it. I can't explain the feeling other than butterflies in my stomach. Anyway, to cut a long story short, I want to buy the full size, but as I live in the UK I find this to be next to impossible, as it's not stocked here anywhere. There was a perfumery in Spain which everyone recommended, but sadly they don't stock it. There's also LuckyScent in the US, but I have no experience with buying from this site internationally.

Now I understand that the pH of my skin and whatnot will effect how things smell in me.

My question is if this would apply to perfumes as well? Would big name brands like Dior or Channel sell inferior versions in countries like Romania, Serbia etc.. 

I am sure that not every batch turns out the same. Some are probably worse than others. I doubt the worse batch would ever be sent to a country like the UK over Romania."

1593099623,Perfumes,Beginner looking for gourmand scents!,"Hello!

I've recently developed an interest in perfumes, and am interested in expanding my (very very small) collection. I've found that my tastes in perfune fit my career choice as a confectioner, anf I absolutley love gourmand scents. (Soft, white florals come in second place!) My absolute favorite notes are vanilla, sugar, and caramel. I like to smell like dessert!

I've bought two very basic gourmand scents this far, those being Pink Sugar and Prada Candy Gloss. Pink Sugar is by far my favorite despite being cheap. I think it smells like a soft, dreamy cotton candy cloud. Prada Candy Gloss seems divisive, but I think that it smells beautifully fresh, and do not at all get the ""cough syrup"" smell that some people have complained about.  I was also gifted a bottle of Black Opium by my father, but I didn't like the scent on me very much. I think it was the coffee that threw me off. I seem to prefer things that are girly and sugary rather than mature and a little bitter. 

I'd really love any recommendations for your favorite gourmand perfumes, prefferably leaning in the desserty direction! Anything vanillary, chocolatey, sugary, or caramelly goes! 

Thank you ‚ù§"

On my first date with my now called wife I got this Gucci perfume, this was almost 10 years ago and I absolutely love it and refuse to spray it on a non special day.

I have a small collection of perfume thanks to my wife, but nothing compares to this scent.

My question is if a discontinued scent will ever be brought back to life? I have received a new scent from Dior yesterday called Fahrenheit and while it is a very nice perfume I began to question if this is the best that's left of my first experience of a good perfume.

My wife also has this Dior perfume called midnight poison (blue) and she keeps it close to her and doesn't want to finish it. 

So basically does a discontinued perfume ever come back?"

I usually like vanilla, patchouli, amber, praline, and other similar notes. I also like Jasmine and honeysuckle. 

I'd prefer something strong enough that I can notice it, but so much that it makes someone who doesn't like sweet scents feel sick. I'd also prefer something as long lasting as possible and doesn't break the bank (like $80 max, college student here).

1596427282,Perfumes,What are your favorite white floral fragrances?,"For tuberose, I‚Äôve tried Diptyque Do Son (love it, it‚Äôs so pretty, fresh, and natural), Amouage Love Tuberose (amazing!! Hard to explain but it smells like a fluffy warm creamy cloud to me, probably because of the whipped cream note), and Carolina Herrera Good Girl (I liked it but it was a little bit strong for me and not as smooth or floral as I like). I haven‚Äôt had a chance to try Good Girl Legere which I heard is more floral and less heavy on the cacao. I didn‚Äôt realize I loved tuberose until recently. On my list to try: Frederic Malle Carnal Flower, by Kilian Beyond Love, Le Labo Lys 41, Robert Piquet Fracas, Rogue Perfumery Champs Lunaires, Gucci Bloom, Hermes Twilly, Good Girl Legere, Tom Ford Orchid Soleil, McQueen EDP, Solstice Scents Nightgown (heard this one smells like the Amouage!).. any other recommendations?

Jasmine- my favorite that I‚Äôve tried is definitely Van Cleef &amp; Arpels California Reverie, but I haven‚Äôt tried many jasmine dominant fragrances. Mugler Alien seems like it would be perfect based on the notes in it but something about it smells very harsh to me and gives me an instance headache, which is so disappointing!

Orange blossom- I love Parfums de Marly Safanad! Many people like Love by Kilian but it‚Äôs very strong on the marshmallow note and not floral enough for me. I think Safanad is so much better and more pleasant if you found Love too sweet. I also have Memo Paris Granada, which is so beautiful but unfortunately is a bit too heavy for me and tends to give me a headache. Something about it reminds me of Alien but it‚Äôs much nicer in my opinion. I haven‚Äôt tried that many orange blossom fragrances so I‚Äôd love to hear your recommendations. 

I love plumeria but I haven‚Äôt had the chance to try any plumeria perfumes, but on my list to try are Annick Goutal Songes and Chantecaille Frangipane."

1596492313,Perfumes,Seeking perfume recommendations,"Hello everyone! I‚Äôm looking for a new perfume but am having a hard time doing so while sheltering in place. Where I am, many places aren‚Äôt open just yet but even if they were, i don‚Äôt feel quite safe venturing out with California surging as badly as it is. I was hoping to crowd source recommendations based on some of what I like to find samples online and make an informed purchase. 

I have always loved a floriental or white floral fragrance. Some that I‚Äôve owned and enjoyed to varying degrees:
Coco Mademoiselle
Serge Lutens Datura Noir
Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab Snow White

I‚Äôve also loved the idea of:
Tom Ford Jasmin Rouge
Diptyque Eau Duelle
Maison Margiela Beach Walk

The last three I‚Äôve owned but felt silage was weak, so I don‚Äôt feel I can buy them again. I find I love white tropical notes (lush jasmine) or warmer notes (saffron, deep vanilla or even coconut without veering into sunscreen territory). Two dream fragrances were Killian Imperial Tea and Jo Malone Saffron but they were sadly discontinued when I wanted to buy them. I‚Äôm open to mainstream brands (I enjoy Dior hypnotic poison a bit) but I do prefer a more niche house if possible as I feel the scents are more unique."

1588639319,Perfumes,Can Anyone Identify This Perfume? I'd Love The Help,"So I've been recently getting into perfume and wish to expand my collection. Since I was a kid I was obsessed with this tiny bottle of perfume my mom had in her jewelry box that she never wore. There was something about it that I just liked. Now I'm 20 and I want to know more about it to see if I can get this perfume myself. There's no information on this tiny bottle that I can really go off from. 

My mom got this over 10 years ago as a gift. She said that this person said she bought it from the Virgin Islands. I'm so new to perfumes I really can't describe the smell by the notes or categories it could be under. At most I can say that it's strong and vintage smelling. If there is any fragrance I can compare it to, it's Chanel's COCO Eau de Toilette. 

I really don't want to use up what's in this bottle because I'd rather use it as a keepsake. If anyone can help me out I'd be elated!

My problem in finding a good perfume is that scents are either too sweet and floral, or they have too much overpowering musk for me.

I think I want something aquatic, fresh, or fruity.
Im interested in the descriptions of perfumes by Get A Room, Juliette Has A Gun, and Mugler's Angel.

Anyone have any starting points to recommend, or just a perfume that they really love?

Smelled YSL Libre on a magazine and really liked it, don't really know much about the duration of it, but while browsing, saw Black Opium and really caught my eye. Since I have to buy it online, I can't really go to a department store and smell it personally.

Have you tried one of these perfumes? Which one is better? I like both floral and sweet perfumes, that's why I can't decide.

Thank you!!!"
1589019762,Perfumes,Perfume recommendations?,"So I'm going out tomorrow to buy my mom a perfume for mothers day, but I really don't know the first thing about fragrance.

Due to the virus my options are a bit limited to drugstore or Ulta (my local Walgreens has a huge wall of perfumes). Thank you!"
1589047452,Perfumes,Rochas Femme vs Rochas Femme 2013,"Hi.  So I've heard a lot about Rochas Femme, a fruity chypre that's  basically the stuff of legends. Found it on sale on Notino for quite  cheap ($40ish/‚Ç¨32ish), though I have never smelled it before. Still, I  love chypre as a genre (adore Mitsouko, Diaghilev, Amouage Fate,  Jubilation), and this being what could be considered a reference  fragrance, I am highly considering buying it.

However,  there's the issue of formulation. Notino's offering both what seems to  be the original (it's just labelled ""Rochas Femme"") *and*  ""Rochas Femme 2013"". It's weird to me that Notino would actually sell  vintage fragrances (they don't usually do that afaik), and the official  Rochas website doesn't tell me much, so I'm a bit confused.

Does  anyone have experience with this fragrance? What could you tell me  about it (old version vs. new version etc.)? Also, what's your take on  the Notino thing? Would it actually be possible that they're selling a  vintage bottle? Thanks"

1589333992,Perfumes,Perfume Suddenly Disappeared?,"So I managed to get my hands on another bottle of perfume and I grew to really like it even though I'm usually not interested in sweet smelling perfumes. It took me a while to be able to find it on the internet for some reason despite having all the information on the packaging. I was told this perfume, Star by Suchel Camacho, was a Cuban brand but I wanted to confirm it because I know nothing about Cuban perfumery. I did eventually find it online. I forgot how much this bottle costs so I looked it up again. Now it's no where. I keep rephrasing my search words time and time again and I'm seeing no results. I find results for other S&amp;C fragrances but not Star even though I it's been featured on google and fragrance sites before. Is there a reason why this fragrance just vanished out of sight? 

Here's an image of the bottle in case anyone's familiar with Star.

I never was a big perfume user. I have 2 perfumes I really like but I don't think the scent is really ""me"". But.. how do I find the scent that ""fits"" to me everyday &amp; I personally really like, too? I would love to hear your stories, how you found the ""one"" (or multiple?) perfumes which really, not represents you, more like ""enhances"" YOU? 

I already had a lot of incorrect purchases in the past, because when I go to a perfume store &amp; smell everything, somehow I think ""yeah this smells awesome"" but when I try it at home it kind of sucks, or doesn't fit to me at all.. any tips or tricks for that?

If you have any recommendation though, for scents that are a very gentle sweetness &amp; are almost not there, but you smell it?

I've had the pleasure of getting a sample of Confessions of a Garden Gnome, by Fort &amp; Manle, and I actually fell head over heels in love with it. I can't explain the feeling other than butterflies in my stomach. Anyway, to cut a long story short, I want to buy the full size, but as I live in the UK I find this to be next to impossible, as it's not stocked here anywhere. There was a perfumery in Spain which everyone recommended, but sadly they don't stock it. There's also LuckyScent in the US, but I have no experience with buying from this site internationally.   


Can anyone share a safe site where I can buy this? (Obviously checked their own site but sadly they don't deliver here).  


And also, can you recommend me something similar? I'm not usually a fan of florals at all, but this one won my heart."

Now I understand that the pH of my skin and whatnot will effect how things smell in me.

My question is if this would apply to perfumes as well? Would big name brands like Dior or Channel sell inferior versions in countries like Romania, Serbia etc.. 

I am sure that not every batch turns out the same. Some are probably worse than others. I doubt the worse batch would ever be sent to a country like the UK over Romania."

1593099623,Perfumes,Beginner looking for gourmand scents!,"Hello!

I've recently developed an interest in perfumes, and am interested in expanding my (very very small) collection. I've found that my tastes in perfune fit my career choice as a confectioner, anf I absolutley love gourmand scents. (Soft, white florals come in second place!) My absolute favorite notes are vanilla, sugar, and caramel. I like to smell like dessert!

I've bought two very basic gourmand scents this far, those being Pink Sugar and Prada Candy Gloss. Pink Sugar is by far my favorite despite being cheap. I think it smells like a soft, dreamy cotton candy cloud. Prada Candy Gloss seems divisive, but I think that it smells beautifully fresh, and do not at all get the ""cough syrup"" smell that some people have complained about.  I was also gifted a bottle of Black Opium by my father, but I didn't like the scent on me very much. I think it was the coffee that threw me off. I seem to prefer things that are girly and sugary rather than mature and a little bitter. 

I'd really love any recommendations for your favorite gourmand perfumes, prefferably leaning in the desserty direction! Anything vanillary, chocolatey, sugary, or caramelly goes! 

Thank you ‚ù§"

Is anyone familiar with this scent, or the notes they're saying it has?  I would love a 'real life' replica but no idea where to start!

Since I was a kid I was obsessed with this tiny bottle of perfume my mom had in her jewelry box that she never wore. There was something about it that I just liked. Now I'm 20 and I want to know more about it to see if I can get this perfume myself. There's no information on this tiny bottle that I can really go off from. 

My mom got this over 10 years ago as a gift. She said that this person said she bought it from the Virgin Islands. I'm so new to perfumes I really can't describe the smell by the notes or categories it could be under. At most I can say that it's strong and vintage smelling. If there is any fragrance I can compare it to, it's Chanel's COCO Eau de Toilette. 

I really don't want to use up what's in this bottle because I'd rather use it as a keepsake. If anyone can help me out I'd be elated!

1589047452,Perfumes,Rochas Femme vs Rochas Femme 2013,"Hi.  So I've heard a lot about Rochas Femme, a fruity chypre that's  basically the stuff of legends. Found it on sale on Notino for quite  cheap ($40ish/‚Ç¨32ish), though I have never smelled it before. Still, I  love chypre as a genre (adore Mitsouko, Diaghilev, Amouage Fate,  Jubilation), and this being what could be considered a reference  fragrance, I am highly considering buying it.

However,  there's the issue of formulation. Notino's offering both what seems to  be the original (it's just labelled ""Rochas Femme"") *and*  ""Rochas Femme 2013"". It's weird to me that Notino would actually sell  vintage fragrances (they don't usually do that afaik), and the official  Rochas website doesn't tell me much, so I'm a bit confused.

Does  anyone have experience with this fragrance? What could you tell me  about it (old version vs. new version etc.)? Also, what's your take on  the Notino thing? Would it actually be possible that they're selling a  vintage bottle? Thanks"

It took me a while to be able to find it on the internet for some reason despite having all the information on the packaging. I was told this perfume, Star by Suchel Camacho, was a Cuban brand but I wanted to confirm it because I know nothing about Cuban perfumery. I did eventually find it online. I forgot how much this bottle costs so I looked it up again. Now it's no where. I keep rephrasing my search words time and time again and I'm seeing no results. I find results for other S&amp;C fragrances but not Star even though I it's been featured on google and fragrance sites before. Is there a reason why this fragrance just vanished out of sight?

I would love to hear your stories, how you found the ""one"" (or multiple?) perfumes which really, not represents you, more like ""enhances"" YOU? 

I already had a lot of incorrect purchases in the past, because when I go to a perfume store &amp; smell everything, somehow I think ""yeah this smells awesome"" but when I try it at home it kind of sucks, or doesn't fit to me at all.. any tips or tricks for that?

It would have been from the late 90s to early 2000's, the base was oval shaped like a shallow soup bowl, and then cap was silver with a needle on it and a thin black ribbon going through the needle hole. It smelled sweet and was a deep yellow color.

If anyone knows the name please let me know!

But in order for me to create the best experience I need some imput from my target demographic. Therefore this question: ""what do you value from your perfumes?"". This might of course be a select smell but also a little thing that stood out from all the other perfumes, like Nice packaging or a little extra that came with the perfume itself. I would really appreciate some feedback on which perfume you liked the most and what made it so special.

1593099623,Perfumes,Beginner looking for gourmand scents!,"Hello!

I've recently developed an interest in perfumes, and am interested in expanding my (very very small) collection. I've found that my tastes in perfune fit my career choice as a confectioner, anf I absolutley love gourmand scents. (Soft, white florals come in second place!) My absolute favorite notes are vanilla, sugar, and caramel. I like to smell like dessert!

I've bought two very basic gourmand scents this far, those being Pink Sugar and Prada Candy Gloss. Pink Sugar is by far my favorite despite being cheap. I think it smells like a soft, dreamy cotton candy cloud. Prada Candy Gloss seems divisive, but I think that it smells beautifully fresh, and do not at all get the ""cough syrup"" smell that some people have complained about.  I was also gifted a bottle of Black Opium by my father, but I didn't like the scent on me very much. I think it was the coffee that threw me off. I seem to prefer things that are girly and sugary rather than mature and a little bitter. 

I'd really love any recommendations for your favorite gourmand perfumes, prefferably leaning in the desserty direction! Anything vanillary, chocolatey, sugary, or caramelly goes! 

Thank you ‚ù§"

I don‚Äôt hate the perfume by any means, but I‚Äôm hoping to find a more grown up, evening type perfume. I‚Äôd love a signature scent, as I will most likely only own one or two bottles at a time. 

The One is a bit fruity and sweet and as I only wear fragrances rarely and only in the evening or sexy dates, I‚Äôm looking for a more adult scent. I‚Äôm okay with bold, and have no issues putting it on before hand if it has a wild/strong opening. I‚Äôve worn cologne and unisex fragrances and I‚Äôm okay with that! My skin has a very sugar sweet natural smell so that fems most fragrances. 

Price isn‚Äôt a concern, as long as I can small some before buying a whole bottle. Are those ebay minis legit? 

Things I like 
Peach notes sit very well on my skin
Rose
Clove 
Anise 
Bergamot
Jasmine 
I‚Äôm okay with tonka but am hoping to find that deep rich vanilla, Amber etc. I‚Äôm not as knowledgeable on what each base note smalls like sorry. 

Things I don‚Äôt like

Now I'm 20 and I want to know more about it to see if I can get this perfume myself. There's no information on this tiny bottle that I can really go off from. 

My mom got this over 10 years ago as a gift. She said that this person said she bought it from the Virgin Islands. I'm so new to perfumes I really can't describe the smell by the notes or categories it could be under. At most I can say that it's strong and vintage smelling. If there is any fragrance I can compare it to, it's Chanel's COCO Eau de Toilette. 

I really don't want to use up what's in this bottle because I'd rather use it as a keepsake. If anyone can help me out I'd be elated!

Im interested in the descriptions of perfumes by Get A Room, Juliette Has A Gun, and Mugler's Angel.

Anyone have any starting points to recommend, or just a perfume that they really love?

Smelled YSL Libre on a magazine and really liked it, don't really know much about the duration of it, but while browsing, saw Black Opium and really caught my eye. Since I have to buy it online, I can't really go to a department store and smell it personally.

Have you tried one of these perfumes? Which one is better? I like both floral and sweet perfumes, that's why I can't decide.

Thank you!!!"

1589047452,Perfumes,Rochas Femme vs Rochas Femme 2013,"Hi.  So I've heard a lot about Rochas Femme, a fruity chypre that's  basically the stuff of legends. Found it on sale on Notino for quite  cheap ($40ish/‚Ç¨32ish), though I have never smelled it before. Still, I  love chypre as a genre (adore Mitsouko, Diaghilev, Amouage Fate,  Jubilation), and this being what could be considered a reference  fragrance, I am highly considering buying it.

However,  there's the issue of formulation. Notino's offering both what seems to  be the original (it's just labelled ""Rochas Femme"") *and*  ""Rochas Femme 2013"". It's weird to me that Notino would actually sell  vintage fragrances (they don't usually do that afaik), and the official  Rochas website doesn't tell me much, so I'm a bit confused.

Does  anyone have experience with this fragrance? What could you tell me  about it (old version vs. new version etc.)? Also, what's your take on  the Notino thing? Would it actually be possible that they're selling a  vintage bottle? Thanks"

It took me a while to be able to find it on the internet for some reason despite having all the information on the packaging. I was told this perfume, Star by Suchel Camacho, was a Cuban brand but I wanted to confirm it because I know nothing about Cuban perfumery. I did eventually find it online. I forgot how much this bottle costs so I looked it up again. Now it's no where. I keep rephrasing my search words time and time again and I'm seeing no results. I find results for other S&amp;C fragrances but not Star even though I it's been featured on google and fragrance sites before. Is there a reason why this fragrance just vanished out of sight? 

Here's an image of the bottle in case anyone's familiar with Star.

I never was a big perfume user. I have 2 perfumes I really like but I don't think the scent is really ""me"". But.. how do I find the scent that ""fits"" to me everyday &amp; I personally really like, too? I would love to hear your stories, how you found the ""one"" (or multiple?) perfumes which really, not represents you, more like ""enhances"" YOU? 

I already had a lot of incorrect purchases in the past, because when I go to a perfume store &amp; smell everything, somehow I think ""yeah this smells awesome"" but when I try it at home it kind of sucks, or doesn't fit to me at all.. any tips or tricks for that?

If you have any recommendation though, for scents that are a very gentle sweetness &amp; are almost not there, but you smell it?

I've had the pleasure of getting a sample of Confessions of a Garden Gnome, by Fort &amp; Manle, and I actually fell head over heels in love with it.

Anyway, to cut a long story short, I want to buy the full size, but as I live in the UK I find this to be next to impossible, as it's not stocked here anywhere. There was a perfumery in Spain which everyone recommended, but sadly they don't stock it. There's also LuckyScent in the US, but I have no experience with buying from this site internationally.

I don‚Äôt hate the perfume by any means, but I‚Äôm hoping to find a more grown up, evening type perfume. I‚Äôd love a signature scent, as I will most likely only own one or two bottles at a time. 

The One is a bit fruity and sweet and as I only wear fragrances rarely and only in the evening or sexy dates, I‚Äôm looking for a more adult scent. I‚Äôm okay with bold, and have no issues putting it on before hand if it has a wild/strong opening. I‚Äôve worn cologne and unisex fragrances and I‚Äôm okay with that! My skin has a very sugar sweet natural smell so that fems most fragrances. 

Price isn‚Äôt a concern, as long as I can small some before buying a whole bottle. Are those ebay minis legit? 

Things I like 
Peach notes sit very well on my skin
Rose
Clove 
Anise 
Bergamot
Jasmine 
I‚Äôm okay with tonka but am hoping to find that deep rich vanilla, Amber etc. I‚Äôm not as knowledgeable on what each base note smalls like sorry. 

Things I don‚Äôt like 
I‚Äôm steering away from ‚Äúcupcake‚Äù sugar sweet 
Patchouli doesn‚Äôt always sit well and can be overpowering, IMO. I‚Äôd be willing to try a scent if it isn‚Äôt patchouli strong. 
Lilies (remind me of a funerals)

So I‚Äôve realised that I really like the more childish candy, supersweet smelling perfumes. I‚Äôve wanted to order one Ariana Grande too but I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt like that one either. There‚Äôs a certain smell in a lot of perfumes that makes it smell too much like.. perfume.. haha.

Now I'm 20 and I want to know more about it to see if I can get this perfume myself. There's no information on this tiny bottle that I can really go off from. 

My mom got this over 10 years ago as a gift. She said that this person said she bought it from the Virgin Islands. I'm so new to perfumes I really can't describe the smell by the notes or categories it could be under. At most I can say that it's strong and vintage smelling. If there is any fragrance I can compare it to, it's Chanel's COCO Eau de Toilette. 

I really don't want to use up what's in this bottle because I'd rather use it as a keepsake. If anyone can help me out I'd be elated!

1589047452,Perfumes,Rochas Femme vs Rochas Femme 2013,"Hi.  So I've heard a lot about Rochas Femme, a fruity chypre that's  basically the stuff of legends. Found it on sale on Notino for quite  cheap ($40ish/‚Ç¨32ish), though I have never smelled it before. Still, I  love chypre as a genre (adore Mitsouko, Diaghilev, Amouage Fate,  Jubilation), and this being what could be considered a reference  fragrance, I am highly considering buying it.

However,  there's the issue of formulation. Notino's offering both what seems to  be the original (it's just labelled ""Rochas Femme"") *and*  ""Rochas Femme 2013"". It's weird to me that Notino would actually sell  vintage fragrances (they don't usually do that afaik), and the official  Rochas website doesn't tell me much, so I'm a bit confused.

Does  anyone have experience with this fragrance? What could you tell me  about it (old version vs. new version etc.)? Also, what's your take on  the Notino thing? Would it actually be possible that they're selling a  vintage bottle? Thanks"

It took me a while to be able to find it on the internet for some reason despite having all the information on the packaging. I was told this perfume, Star by Suchel Camacho, was a Cuban brand but I wanted to confirm it because I know nothing about Cuban perfumery. I did eventually find it online. I forgot how much this bottle costs so I looked it up again. Now it's no where. I keep rephrasing my search words time and time again and I'm seeing no results. I find results for other S&amp;C fragrances but not Star even though I it's been featured on google and fragrance sites before. Is there a reason why this fragrance just vanished out of sight? 

Here's an image of the bottle in case anyone's familiar with Star.

I never was a big perfume user. I have 2 perfumes I really like but I don't think the scent is really ""me"".

I would love to hear your stories, how you found the ""one"" (or multiple?) perfumes which really, not represents you, more like ""enhances"" YOU? 

I already had a lot of incorrect purchases in the past, because when I go to a perfume store &amp; smell everything, somehow I think ""yeah this smells awesome"" but when I try it at home it kind of sucks, or doesn't fit to me at all.. any tips or tricks for that?

I don‚Äôt hate the perfume by any means, but I‚Äôm hoping to find a more grown up, evening type perfume. I‚Äôd love a signature scent, as I will most likely only own one or two bottles at a time. 

The One is a bit fruity and sweet and as I only wear fragrances rarely and only in the evening or sexy dates, I‚Äôm looking for a more adult scent. I‚Äôm okay with bold, and have no issues putting it on before hand if it has a wild/strong opening. I‚Äôve worn cologne and unisex fragrances and I‚Äôm okay with that! My skin has a very sugar sweet natural smell so that fems most fragrances. 

Price isn‚Äôt a concern, as long as I can small some before buying a whole bottle. Are those ebay minis legit? 

Things I like 
Peach notes sit very well on my skin
Rose
Clove 
Anise 
Bergamot
Jasmine 
I‚Äôm okay with tonka but am hoping to find that deep rich vanilla, Amber etc. I‚Äôm not as knowledgeable on what each base note smalls like sorry. 

Things I don‚Äôt like 
I‚Äôm steering away from ‚Äúcupcake‚Äù sugar sweet 
Patchouli doesn‚Äôt always sit well and can be overpowering, IMO. I‚Äôd be willing to try a scent if it isn‚Äôt patchouli strong. 
Lilies (remind me of a funerals)

So I signed up for a couple fragrance sample subscriptions, and did what I always do when I get into something new... I made a massive spreadsheet to organize my journey.

Now I've realized that this spreadsheet might actually be useful for other people, in contrast to my other sheets which, well, are a strange chaotic place that only makes sense to me, lol.

Now I'm 20 and I want to know more about it to see if I can get this perfume myself. There's no information on this tiny bottle that I can really go off from. 

My mom got this over 10 years ago as a gift. She said that this person said she bought it from the Virgin Islands. I'm so new to perfumes I really can't describe the smell by the notes or categories it could be under. At most I can say that it's strong and vintage smelling. If there is any fragrance I can compare it to, it's Chanel's COCO Eau de Toilette. 

I really don't want to use up what's in this bottle because I'd rather use it as a keepsake. If anyone can help me out I'd be elated!

1589047452,Perfumes,Rochas Femme vs Rochas Femme 2013,"Hi.  So I've heard a lot about Rochas Femme, a fruity chypre that's  basically the stuff of legends. Found it on sale on Notino for quite  cheap ($40ish/‚Ç¨32ish), though I have never smelled it before. Still, I  love chypre as a genre (adore Mitsouko, Diaghilev, Amouage Fate,  Jubilation), and this being what could be considered a reference  fragrance, I am highly considering buying it.

However,  there's the issue of formulation. Notino's offering both what seems to  be the original (it's just labelled ""Rochas Femme"") *and*  ""Rochas Femme 2013"". It's weird to me that Notino would actually sell  vintage fragrances (they don't usually do that afaik), and the official  Rochas website doesn't tell me much, so I'm a bit confused.

Does  anyone have experience with this fragrance? What could you tell me  about it (old version vs. new version etc.)? Also, what's your take on  the Notino thing? Would it actually be possible that they're selling a  vintage bottle? Thanks"

I forgot how much this bottle costs so I looked it up again. Now it's no where. I keep rephrasing my search words time and time again and I'm seeing no results.

1582054940,Perfumes,Help my perfume grow up?,"I picked a bottle of The One By D&amp;G almost a decade ago from one of those fragrance sampler gift sets. I don‚Äôt hate the perfume by any means, but I‚Äôm hoping to find a more grown up, evening type perfume. I‚Äôd love a signature scent, as I will most likely only own one or two bottles at a time. 

The One is a bit fruity and sweet and as I only wear fragrances rarely and only in the evening or sexy dates, I‚Äôm looking for a more adult scent. I‚Äôm okay with bold, and have no issues putting it on before hand if it has a wild/strong opening. I‚Äôve worn cologne and unisex fragrances and I‚Äôm okay with that! My skin has a very sugar sweet natural smell so that fems most fragrances. 

Price isn‚Äôt a concern, as long as I can small some before buying a whole bottle. Are those ebay minis legit? 

Things I like 
Peach notes sit very well on my skin
Rose
Clove 
Anise 
Bergamot
Jasmine 
I‚Äôm okay with tonka but am hoping to find that deep rich vanilla, Amber etc. I‚Äôm not as knowledgeable on what each base note smalls like sorry. 

Things I don‚Äôt like 
I‚Äôm steering away from ‚Äúcupcake‚Äù sugar sweet 
Patchouli doesn‚Äôt always sit well and can be overpowering, IMO. I‚Äôd be willing to try a scent if it isn‚Äôt patchouli strong. 
Lilies (remind me of a funerals) 
Raspberry 
That ozone ‚Äúfresh rain‚Äù chemical smell

Bless you if you stuck with my through all that. Fire away if you have any questions, or any suggestions at all.

Or just super ‚Äùchildish‚Äù candy sweet perfumes?,"I‚Äôve never been a fan of perfumes up until a few months ago (kind of feel like its a pregnancy craving of some kind). I became obsessed with Alyssa Ashley Vanilla and wanted some more expensive fun perfumes. 

I ended up ordering Aquolina - Pink Sugar, Dolce Gabbana - The One and Prada - Candy. But I only like Aquolina. I feel like the other two have somewhat of a too grown-up feel to them. 

So I‚Äôve realised that I really like the more childish candy, supersweet smelling perfumes. I‚Äôve wanted to order one Ariana Grande too but I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt like that one either. There‚Äôs a certain smell in a lot of perfumes that makes it smell too much like.. perfume.. haha.

So I want to make homemade soap for personal use, that has the same smell as Dial but no antibacterials. How would you describe the scent?  I get some floral notes - maybe rose?  And maybe some pine?

Purchased at duty free for while traveling as a blind buy earlier this year and never opened.

Open to any reasonable offer..i found the 50ml  retailing for 240, and the 250ml for 615, not many 100ml bottles out there, but this was around 350? I believe 

'Introduced in 2018, tom ford fougere platine is an herbal woody blend that can be worn by women and men. From designer tom ford, a designer based in the united states, this modern scent opens with fresh, green notes of bergamot, clary sage, basil, and lavender.

I don‚Äôt hate the perfume by any means, but I‚Äôm hoping to find a more grown up, evening type perfume. I‚Äôd love a signature scent, as I will most likely only own one or two bottles at a time. 

The One is a bit fruity and sweet and as I only wear fragrances rarely and only in the evening or sexy dates, I‚Äôm looking for a more adult scent. I‚Äôm okay with bold, and have no issues putting it on before hand if it has a wild/strong opening. I‚Äôve worn cologne and unisex fragrances and I‚Äôm okay with that! My skin has a very sugar sweet natural smell so that fems most fragrances. 

Price isn‚Äôt a concern, as long as I can small some before buying a whole bottle. Are those ebay minis legit? 

Things I like 
Peach notes sit very well on my skin
Rose
Clove 
Anise 
Bergamot
Jasmine 
I‚Äôm okay with tonka but am hoping to find that deep rich vanilla, Amber etc. I‚Äôm not as knowledgeable on what each base note smalls like sorry. 

Things I don‚Äôt like 
I‚Äôm steering away from ‚Äúcupcake‚Äù sugar sweet 
Patchouli doesn‚Äôt always sit well and can be overpowering, IMO. I‚Äôd be willing to try a scent if it isn‚Äôt patchouli strong.

1582054940,Perfumes,Help my perfume grow up?,"I picked a bottle of The One By D&amp;G almost a decade ago from one of those fragrance sampler gift sets. I don‚Äôt hate the perfume by any means, but I‚Äôm hoping to find a more grown up, evening type perfume. I‚Äôd love a signature scent, as I will most likely only own one or two bottles at a time. 

The One is a bit fruity and sweet and as I only wear fragrances rarely and only in the evening or sexy dates, I‚Äôm looking for a more adult scent. I‚Äôm okay with bold, and have no issues putting it on before hand if it has a wild/strong opening. I‚Äôve worn cologne and unisex fragrances and I‚Äôm okay with that! My skin has a very sugar sweet natural smell so that fems most fragrances. 

Price isn‚Äôt a concern, as long as I can small some before buying a whole bottle. Are those ebay minis legit? 

Things I like 
Peach notes sit very well on my skin
Rose
Clove 
Anise 
Bergamot
Jasmine 
I‚Äôm okay with tonka but am hoping to find that deep rich vanilla, Amber etc. I‚Äôm not as knowledgeable on what each base note smalls like sorry. 

Things I don‚Äôt like 
I‚Äôm steering away from ‚Äúcupcake‚Äù sugar sweet 
Patchouli doesn‚Äôt always sit well and can be overpowering, IMO. I‚Äôd be willing to try a scent if it isn‚Äôt patchouli strong. 
Lilies (remind me of a funerals) 
Raspberry
