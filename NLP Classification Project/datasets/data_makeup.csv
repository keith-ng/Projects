1658755216,Makeup,Rare beauty blush shade recommendation?,"I’m wanting to buy a soft pinch liquid blush from Rare beauty but I’m so unsure about which would be the best shade for me. I can’t try any store testers, as I live in South Africa and Rare beauty isn’t stocked in any stores here, and is only sporadically available online. 

I have pale/fair skin with pink undertones, dark brown hair and green eyes. I’m wanting to buy a blush that looks very natural. I already have the Rare beauty cream blush in Nearly mauve which I love. Does anyone have any shade recommendations for the liquid blush?"
1658757388,Makeup,Should tinted moisturiser be set with powder?,"I got the Laura Mercier oil free tinted moisturiser recently which has great reviews. It’s my first tinted moisturiser so I don’t have any other experience with them &amp; I guess I saw it differently to foundation &amp; thought the point was it was meant to be low maintenance &amp; you just put it on &amp; go, treating it like I would wearing moisturiser. But I was a total oil slick in an hour or two &amp; it looked terrible.

Should I be wearing it the same way I wear foundation, setting it with powder &amp; also using primer/fixing spray if needed? And whilst I’m on the subject should I also be putting my normal moisturiser on first, or is this meant to moisturise adequately alone?

I guess I’m disappointed as that doesn’t seem any less effort than wearing foundation is, but maybe that’s my own mistake for expecting that from it &amp; the only difference is meant to be that it’s more lighter &amp; natural looking? Though that just makes me think I can get the same effect by using less of my normal foundation &amp; more sheered out or even mixed in with my moisturiser."

1658784060,Makeup,Boyfriend looking for Purchase Recommendations?,"Hi everybody, hopefully I'm in the right subreddit or can get sent there by one of you!

So my partner is pretty hard to shop for and experiences an amount of ""gift anxiety"" (feelings of ""I don't deserve this/it's too nice for me/buying me stuff is a waste"") that makes gift giving even trickier, but recently we were at a Winners and came across some of what I think are called palettes? They're little packs with 12 to 16 different coloured squares of makeup that seem to be used for eyeshadow. And apparently they were exciting enough that I was allowed to buy one as a gift! Which was something I haven't experienced before with this partner because again, there's a lot of negative/guilty emotions around gift giving that I'm always kind of running up against. 

The three total we wound up with were called **Rude x Koi Footwear Boots Collection - Helios Hologram Flame Boots, Rude x Koi Footwear Boots Collection - Lozo Green Rain Boots** and **BH Cosmetics Avocado Toast Shadow Palette** and all three have been super popular already.

Anyway, now that I seem to have an outlet to express my gift giving affection I'd like to learn more about what would be worth buying in the future. I have very little understanding of makeup but I can give some rough notes about my partner;

Winged eyeliner, mascara and eyeshadow is pretty common but lipstick apparently comes across ""trashy"" a lot of the time (I guess because it's a bit dolled up or showy or something?) and the general vibe is pretty alternative, punk, probably goth but I have to be a bit careful with that because I have kind of a known goth girl dating history and it would maybe land wrong as a gift if it seemed like I was pressuring my current partner to dress up as previous partners/flings/etc. Aside from that, not much for coverup/foundation/etc., it's mostly all just... eyework? Is that what you call it?

The palettes are getting a ton of use but from reading online it seems like these are maybe like, ""cheap"" ones or entry level or sort of frugal? I try to equate it with stuff I know like coffee or car parts where you can buy higher grade stuff for a better experience, I assume it's similar here? Are there higher quality palettes that still have the fun alt kind of vibes? 

Aside from that for mascara or eyeliner we seem to usually just wind up with whatever is at Walmart or the pharmacy - usually that Elf brand stuff. I don't know if Elf is fine, I think every girl I've ever dated had some of that in their bathroom, but again connecting to what I am familiar with, Wal-Mart coffee or engine oil isn't really something I'd go in for.

Budget is basically whatever, I'm sure there are like ten thousand dollar kits or whatever that would make me feel silly for saying that but these were super cheap and I'd be happy spending more to get better stuff to use. I'm also down for any kind of links for reading or whatever so I can understand what I'm doing better and not buy pointless stuff, if anyone has any of that?

Thanks in advance, everybody!"
1658784468,Makeup,Misprint or knock-off?,"I have been trying so hard to find a review of this one lipstick that I bought from my local beauty store because it's on sale. But I found none.

Now I think this might have happened because the products are on sale so maybe it's a product that had misprints or has been on the shelf for too long (I have no idea how any of these works). But when I checked up with the other one there's no problem with it. What do I do should I call up the store and ask? I am so paranoid."

1658851286,Makeup,Ilia Super Serum Skin Tint VS. Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer Natural Skin Perfector,"I’ve recently purchased both of these products while looking for an alternative to foundation.  I really love both products and they seem to look the same on me, so I don’t need to keep both of them but can’t decide which to return/keep. They both have similar ratings on EWG but different flagged ingredients (see below) so I’m trying to determine if one is better/safer than the other in that regard but I don’t know much about skincare chemicals but I’m pregnant and want to keep it as clean as I can.

Ilia pros are that it has a light, smooth coverage with SPF 40. Cons are that it smells awful and has zinc oxide (12%).

Laura Mercier pros are that it also has a light smooth coverage but no detectable scent. Cons are that the SPF 30 is lower than Ilia’s and it contains oxybenzone (1%).

Can anyone weigh in on which one they think is the keeper? Or give me a really good reason to keep both?"

Before those 7 years I wore lash strips for 3 years. I’ve always hated the way I look without lashes since my real lashes are very small and don’t curl (I have Asian lashes). The thing with extensions is I can just wake up and feel pretty, go swimming and still look good and even cry and not be totally disgusted by the way I look after. My boyfriend has only ever known me with my extensions too. 

The place I’ve been going for the past 7 years have raised their prices from 60$ to 90$ for a fill. And on top of that they’re shortening the time from 3 weeks to 2 weeks?? It seems so unreasonable and just greedy. I’m in college now and can’t afford that extra raise. (Plus I drive an hour to the salon since it’s located in my hometown). 

I’ve tried to look at new salons near me but I’m in the city so their prices are the same if not more expensive. And I have thought about just cutting off but these extensions have really given me more confidence in myself. Also I love just waking up and being ready to go. I’m debating to have my boyfriend learn how to do them and just buying lash kits online.

1658870444,Makeup,Makeup Wipe Rec Needed,"I don't use makeup wipes regularly since I prefer the deep and gentle clean of an oil / balm remover. Most of the time my makeup is incredibly minimal - just spot concealing. So the whole process of going through the massaging, the emulsifying, and the rinsing can feel a bit overbearing. At those times I wipe off the makeup using a micellar water and a cotton pad. Which is fine when I'm at home.   


But for travel (especially on days when I spending the night at someone's house), I wouldn't mind the ease of a one step wipe to remove my minimal makeup. Of course I would cleanse afterwards. I wouldn't do this often since wipes can seem wasteful and harsh on the skin. But in a pinch it seems like a good product to have. Makeup balms / oils can kinda gunk up the sink so I feel horrible about doing that to another person's sink. What makeup wipes would you recommend?"

1658876698,Makeup,lipstick recommendations for an overwhelmed person,"hi! so im new to makeup but i do like a little color on my lips and im particularly interested with this popular look of korean style lips; i love how soft and kind of 'natural' the lips look

doing research ive seen they mostly use lip stains i cant find at ulta (and the ones they have are a bit expensive). it seems liquid lipstick would kind of work for the look by applying the lipstick with your fingers and blotting it, but i am scared bc liquid lipstick has always been my enemy as i have dry lips and it makes me look like a clown (not used to seeing me with obvious makeup)

Do you have any recommendations for an affordable nude palette with cool tones? 🥹"
1658935676,Makeup,How do y'all manage to do your makeup so quickly?,"Days ago, I got downvoted for saying that it takes me 70 minutes to do a simple makeup look. Not sure why I got downvoted, but no matter how hard I try, I can never do a full face of makeup in under an hour.

Mascara is my longest step, because my lashes won't curl unless I curl them at least 5 times each, and since my lashes as less than a centimeter long, I have to apply mascara slowly, or else I'll get it all over my eye area.

Foundation/concealer is my second longest step, because I have acne all over my face, so I use full-coverage foundation and it take forever to blend, and even after I blend it, some don't fully cover, so I have to apply some concealer over them then blend them out with my finger.

Eyeliner is my least favorite step, because it takes forever to make both sides look even.

Even blush and bronzer take me some time, because it also struggle to make both sides of my face look even.

I also wear primer, eyebrow powder, eyeshadow (usually just 2 or 3 colors), lashes, lipstick, and setting spray which adds even more time.

And if I were to do a full-glam look, that'll take me over 2 hours.

So how do you all manage to do your makeup in under an hour? By any chance, does it correspond with your general art skills? I literally can't draw or color anything, so could that be why I suck at applying makeup?"

My “mom makeup” routine:


Toner (I don’t wash my face in the morning), moisturizer and a primer. I use a lot of different ones but current favorite is CoverGirl Outlast Stay All Day Primer. 


Next is Hollywood Flawless Filter by Charlotte Tilbury, it hides a lot of texture. I put that on my face along with ELF Hydrating Camo Concealer and blend. You can see my skin but I still have coverage. Set with Maybelline SuperStay Powder Foundation. 


Then Laura Gellar Balance ‘N Brighten Bronzer and I use either Benefit Dallas blush or Hourglass diffused heat (sometimes both.) Then blend. If I’m feeling like it I use Ciate Dewy Sticks. 


Then brows, I’m pretty blessed with nice brows but they are bleach blonde and I currently have dark hair. I fill them in with a Maybelline brow pencil and then Gimme Brow. 


If I’m really in a rush I stop there although sometimes I’ll put on mascara. Otherwise I use three shadows: a matte brown for the crease, black to line the upper lash line and a highlight. I really like Milani Bold Obsessions for that but I use the Kaja stack in Chocolate Dahlia a lot too. Often use Benefit Dallas in my crease. Then Essence Doll Lash mascara and whatever setting spray I have laying around. 


Sounds like a lot but it never takes more than 10 minutes. What do you use?!?"

COMMENT 1:
--------------------- 

💄 Monthly Makeup Routine Review Recap • July, '22 

...... 

➡️ NOTE: the information contained within this post is based upon my research, opinions, and experience. As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored nor quid pro quo. I do it for fun. NO FILTERS OR EDITS USED IN MY PICTURES, EVER. 

...... 

🧐 PURPOSE: every month I'm shopping my stash for a REASONABLE amount of products from each makeup category. Over the course of the month, I'm going to really get to learn about each product in-depth, and eventually relay to you - the findings. During this process, I'm also figuring out which products I'm completely decluttering from my collection. 

...... 

🔹️POTENTIAL PROCESS QUESTIONS: 


+ Total Products This Month: 23
+ Total Products I'm Keeping: 19
+ Total Products I'm Decluttering: 4
+ Total Products 'COMPLETELY' Finished: 0
+ Total Products 'ALMOST' Finished: 2
+ % of Routine Finished/Decluttered: 26% 


• DECLUTTERED PRODUCTS: will be placed in a special box for the time being as I collect more, but I intend on gathering a few more over time, and selling (the ones I paid for) as a bundle for solely the cost of shipping on my boutique. The products that I got for free (or don't have time to list) will be bundled together and I will hold a bundle giveaway for people who don't mind (sanitized) secondhand products used only by me. 


• PROS OF THIS SYSTEM: significant product knowledge, ability to get intensively creative with products, easy to manage such a small grouping of products, no hard decisions on what makeup to wear every day, means to actually use up products (or make a pretty big dent)


• CONS OF THIS SYSTEM: boredom (I got notably bored at the three-week mark), if something you pick really sucks - you have to explore ways to make it work in other capacities, sadness of potentially decluttering something you spent a lot of money on if it doesn't perform

1659101383,Makeup,Why is waterproof makeup so hard to work with?,"So I've been using the Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation for a long time but it looks horrendous on me. I've tried a lot of different combinations of different skincare and primers, and nothing seems to make it actually look good. The only reason I keep purchasing it, is because I'm extremely pale and the 0n1 Alabaster shade is the closest thing to my skin tone that I can find. I use it with the Fenty pro filt'r Hydrating Primer(soft silk) and that seems to make it work.. somewhat. My problem is that the foundation sets so fast, I don't even have time to blend it in properly and it gets very patchy. And god forbid I try to apply a second layer, it always(!) removes the first layer completely. I am thinking it could have to do with their bases? The Double Wear seems to be water/silicone based, but... the Fenty Primer is also? Maybe it has to do with the Hyaluronic Acid I use? I figured it might cling onto the water in the foundation and make it stick on some parts faster than others. Especially since I use a damp beauty blender. But some other foundations that are silicone based work like wonders, for ex. Maybelline Fit me matte and poreless(way too dark for me tho). I don't even need a primer for that. It's only the waterproof formulas that are so hard to work with.

Should you use the Double Wear Foundation with a brush instead of a damp beauty blender? Do I need a different primer? Do I need to use skincare with oils on my face? I honestly don't know what  I am doing wrong anymore..

Btw I have the same problem with the Sheglam 12-Hr-Concealer and Nyx Cant stop wont stop concealer. They all seem to be this waterproof/water-resistant formula. I tried mixing water into it and it just immediately sticks to my skin like glue and cannot be spread/blended in. I'm also looking into Revolution Conceal and Define Foundation, does anyone know if it's the same waterproof formula? It says oil-free so I'm a bit scared lol

For skincare I use different products with HA but nothing with oils(I have very oily dehydrated skin)."

1659115319,Makeup,nonprofit looking for places to purchase bulk makeup for LGBTQ+ transwomen/femmes,"Hi, I help run a nonprofit that specializes in providing HIV risk reduction for LGBTQ+ individuals through a variety of service programs.

Gender affirming care, clothing, and supplies are one of the services this program provides to assist women with their self-esteem, thriving in their environment, and to live as their authentic selves. As such, one of the groups we run is all about transition options (both social and medical options), but the facilitators will also provide makeup lessons to those who are interested. 

We would love to supply makeup to participants that attend group so they can live their best lives, but what is a good place for us to buy makeup in bulk?

1659116320,Makeup,My bridal MUA deleted all posts from her Insta. Now I feel a bit underwhelmed about booking her.,"I booked a celebrity makeup artist for my wedding in November. She did two of my friends and my cousins wedding make up and it was flawless! She is a master at her craft. Now I thought that I too like my cousins and friends will get to show off my makeup look and my outfits and my designers etc through her page. I spent the last whole year curating and putting together. She has over 300k followers on Instagram. 
Today I checked her profile to discuss some of her makeup looks that I had saved. on Instagram with my sisters. I was shocked to find that she has deleted all her posts and reels from her page. When I asked her where her bridal posts went. She said she deleted them for religious reasons. 

I just suddenly feel weird and underwhelmed about the whole thing. I mean if I had to keep it on the down low I could have hired a normally good MUA and not a celebrity one. I hired a celebrity MUA at those rates for a certain vibe. But now I feel that from her when she doesn’t want to show any brides on her page. 

I didn’t discuss it with her cz I respect her religious sentiments. 

I can still cancel her but I have many mutual acquaintances with her . Nothing too close or major.

1659122025,Makeup,Makeup settling and texture,"I need some help with my foundation technique. I find that even after giving my Moisturizer and primer time to settle in, when I go to apply my concealer and foundation, it settles into my pores as I am applying, and gets a separated look straight away. No matter if I apply and try to blend in with a damp beauty blender, or dab on with my fingers gently. I just cannot get a smooth or even application. I have roscea, and the skin of my cheeks is quite red, but i feel like when I'm smoothing in my primer, I get it feeling smooth enough, but then boom, foundation application proves me wrong. I use a CeraVe Moisturizer, Elf Poreless Face primer, Covergirl Trueblend Undercover concealer, and Maybelline SuperStay Active Wear foundation. Also, no matter if I use primer, setting spray or what, foundation NEVER wants to stay on my nose. I have an oily nose, but I feel like with my skincare, shouldn't that be helping it not be so oily? I go to apply foundation on my nose, a Tap it on with my damp sponge, the product sits there, then when I tap it more to blend into my skin, instead it just disappears. Then, I'll try to cover up that uneven application by dabbing foundation onto my nose, but even then I have to use the absolute faintest pressure, or it will rub right off again.

What's the deal with them?,"So Benefit kinda just suddenly launched a new brow pencil that's supposed to be volumizing and have fibers and stuff - apparently it's all very innovative in the brow pencil domain.

I've kind of wanted to hear people's thoughts on them because I'm intrigued but not sure if it's worth the hype or if it's just another brow pencil. I'm also pretty curious about the shades because the blonde ones look very light in the photos, especially compared to their other pencils. But I can't find anything about them - no YT videos, it doesn't look like they sent them out via influenster so there's no pictures in the reviews, instagram search is pretty useless, and I'm not on TikTok. I can't tell if they're an online only item or if my nearest Ulta store just hasn't gotten them yet.

How do you do a ""full face"" of makeup without them?","I usually just do light eyeliner, mascara, and eyebrow makeup. I like to experiment with highlighter, eyeshadow, or lip products, but I've never gone out with it since my sister says it looks unfinished/unpolished. I never use any skin products like concealer, primer, or foundation due to both personal preference (I prefer a minimalist look) and because I have skin reactions to most skin products. 

So, I am looking to find a way to do a so-called ""full face"" of makeup without skin products. And by full face I mean: eyeshadow, mascara, eyebrow pen, cream eyeshadow, lip tint, and maybe highlighter. But, I don't know how to do it without looking 'incomplete' or 'unpolished'.

Any suggestions on how I could achieve this look and still look polished, or is it impossible to do without skin products?

I've watched a lot of videos and tutorials where concealing is done, but they never go right up under the eye and into the lashline. 

My eyelashes are very dark ask well and thick, so they cast a shadow and emphasize the discoloration more. 

Do you think I'm perhaps seeing an issue that isn't really there? Or does anyone else have this? I can't even use a shadow under my eye like everyone does because it looks silly on me. I look tired.

i used the sephora app find your shade thing to find my closest shade which is medium with cool olive undertones? apparently not the medium with neutral undertones considering in fenty it’s medium skin with neutral undertones?

1659194574,Makeup,help identifying very old clear acrylic palette with cream highlighters eye shadows and lipglosses inside,"Hi


I wondered if you could help me identify some make up I had.

About 15 years ago I got two make up palettes but I can't remember the brand because I was a teen and threw them away years ago.

They were mid range price point. Good quality, large, thick solid clear acrylic cases about 25cm x 15cm so you could see the make up colours through the case. The outer surfaces had a slight wave to it, not completely flat.

Everything inside was creamy consistency. Cream highlighters, cream eyeshadow, lipgloss. ( I know this sounds like some cheap crap from how I'm explaining it, but it wasn't, it was higher end for the time).

So you could see the colours through the case and the make up wasn't in just squares or circles. I remember one had it in large candy shapes the other was something similar. When you open the case the make up is on both sides. I think the same shape in both sides but different colours.

This make up wasn't drug store or anything, no one else I knew had it. It was a gift from my mum. We're based in the UK if that helps. Probably bought from Selfridges or somewhere similar.

Does anyone know what brand this might be. I'm sorry if I didn't describe it well.

Thank you so much."

Today i wore makeup but when i went to wash my face at the end of the night I realized i forgot my makeup remover home. Most of my makeup came off when i washed my face but the waterproof mascara i used didnt (obviously). We still have one week left of the trip and we’re in a moderately small town so i dont know if i can find any place to buy eye makeup remover. What would be the best alternatives that i can use to remove it tomorrow? Something that i can hopefully find in the local supermarket here? I dont feel great about sleeping in mascara especially since its pretty thick but its late at night so i dont have any other option. I hope this post made sense and thanks in advance

1659284299,Makeup,Che cos'è la laminazione ciglia?," 

**Che cos'è la laminazione ciglia?**

La  laminazione ciglia è un trattamento estetico non invasivo e indolore  che viene eseguito sulle ciglia naturali, il cui scopo è curvare,  riordinare, ispessire, allungare e nutrire il pelo. L'effetto è  semipermanente (6-8 settimane), spesso utilizzato in alternativa alle  più artificiali extension ciglia.

Attraverso  l'applicazione di particolari prodotti le ciglia possono assumere la  curvatura e la pettinatura desiderata, donando un'effetto simile a  quello ottenibile con mascara e piegaciglia (ossia più ordinato e  voluminoso) ma anche più duraturo. I prodotti utilizzati hanno anche lo  scopo di nutrire e migliorare le ciglia.

**Processi chimici e tecniche**

Per  rimodellare la forma e ottenere un eccellente lifting ciglia, la  laminazione è necessario agisca sui “ponti di zolfo”, aminoacidi  solforati chiamati disolfuri. I ponti allo zolfo sono tra i maggiori  responsabili della struttura, della stabilità e dell’aspetto di ciglia e  capelli, e si trovano nella Cistina, un amminoacido della Cheratina.

Per  rompere o ridurre questi ponti, le ciglia vengono anzitutto trattate  con un riducente, il cui scopo è disidratare il pelo, sollevando le  squame della cuticola così da ridurre i ponti. che disidrata il pelo.

I  riducenti più usati sono della famiglia dei Tioli che, usati in  concentrazioni adeguate e con tempistiche ben precise, svolgano la loro  funzione di riduzione dei ponti di zolfo, senza danneggiare la ciglia.

Durante  la riduzione di questi ponti di zolfo, le ciglia sono denaturalizzate e  si trovano in una condizione di modellabilità. I legami impiegano  alcune ore prima di riformarsi ed è in questo lasso di tempo che avviene  la vera e propria laminazione, in quanto le ciglia si possono modellare  secondo la forma desiderata (ad esempio su una formina curva in  silicone poggiata sulle palpebre, detta patch o ""bigodino"").

I  ponti interrotti dai riducenti devono a questo punto ricostituirsi  utilizzando un neutralizzante che blocca il processo di destrutturazione  e fissa la forma finale.

In  questa fase in cui le ciglia sono ancora ricettive ai nutrienti vengono  introdotti dei preparati specifici a base di Cheratina, Ialuronico e  Staminali, con l'obbiettivo di riempirle e irrobustirle, donando un  effetto ringiovanente al pelo, portandolo ad avere un aspetto più  voluminoso, lungo e sano.

**Vantaggi**

La  laminazione ciglia è un trattamento oltre che di bellezza anche  curativo. Spesso sono gli stessi oculisti e ottici che consigliano la  laminazione per correggere determiante problematiche, quali ciglia  ricurve che irritano l'occhio o ciglia che disturbano per l'utilizzo di  lenti/occhiali. Tale trattamento è consigliato per coloro con ciglia: -  troppo dritte o all’ingiù, per renderle più folte e visibili; - molto  disordinate/incrociate per renderle pù ordinate; - molto secche e  sfibrate, per renderle più sane, rivitalizzate e nutrite; - molto  sottili, per ispessire e allungare il pelo; - molto lunghe e rigide, per  rendere il pelo più morbido, setoso e naturale."

I am guy who over the year developed acne but has it under control. I learnt much through my journey and one of the things I learned was that sunscreen is the number one ingredient to combat aging. As I am 18 years old and already started sunscreen on daily basis I think I have a bright future in that aspect.

However, the sunscreen i like and use leaves a good shiny finish. I don't like that and would like to counter it somehow. Got some tips about powder and my first intention was that I would never start makeup. But, in reality, it isn't that weird. 

So, do you have any powders as I have no experience in this area. Any tips are welcome!"

Plus, I’m looking for shadows that are solid and matte, and not so shimmery. They have the pressed powders available online but I want something I can pick up in store.

1656174915,Makeup,Fuss-less mascaras and dark undereye cures?,"I am in a total mascara rut and just can't find something to try and wading through drugstore mascaras is just so hit and miss. I wanted to see if anyone here might be able to suggest something. I'm currently using Saie mascara and it's not bad, I like that it comes off clean but I'd like to try something that gives a little more oomph. Something that comes off clean but won't leave panda eyes since I think I have oily lids? 

The second product I'm looking for I could use some advice on. My undereyes are darker because I've had perpetual sleep problems for years now, and also have deeper natural creases under them. I have really good skin so I don't usually use concealer but the times I have I find it ineffective or too gummy to work with. Is there a good medium coverage concealer or maybe a powder would work better?

If any of y'all have ideas for either of these I'd be so so so grateful. Thanks!"

1656179914,Makeup,"Having difficulty choosing good shades of eyeshadow (cool summer, deep set eyes)","I have warm hair with cool skin and deep set blue eyes. I guess I'd be considered a cool summer.

Generally speaking, overly warm colors for lipstick or blush seem to be overwhelming. Magentas and cool pinks seem to work pretty well for my skin tone.

My eyes are a different story. Bright warm tones reduce the darkness on my inner eye, but somehow they just seem a little blah. Cool tones make me seem tired, especially if I use them on my inner eye or under my eye.

So far what I've had best luck with brown on my outer eye and golden shimmer on my inner eye. This works, but I'm wondering if there are any other colors that could work well for me.

Is there anything I can do, or am I better off just embracing neutral browns and gold shimmers?"

1656196961,Makeup,Charlotte Tilbury Question,"So, I'm job hunting in the coming weeks. My field has tons of openings so there's likely going to be several sets of in person interviews (my employer's competitors are all basically in the same geographic location). That said the last time I interviewed I was 25, fresh faced, straight out of grad school, and idealistic. 

Now at 32, I'm in the final stages of a cancer battle (I'm definitely winning), jaded about the job/career field, and just generally more mature skin wise. 

I never really did makeup before but chemo has made me look like death slightly warmed over, so that's going have to change. 

I broke out of my shell and talked to an acquaintance whose makeup I admire and asked if I could buy her coffee and lunch in exchange for a trip to Sephora and Ulta to get some makeup and to help color match some foundation because I can't do it to save my life. She enthusiastically agreed and warned me that makeup, good makeup, wasn't cheap and asked my budget. I gave it to her and this morning we went shopping. 

Now I admit, perhaps I should not have told her my max budget of $300, but I'd done some surfing around and she was right , makeup wasn't cheap, and I had no idea what was good and what wasn't. 

We ended up finding a really good color match with Charlotte Tilbury at Sephora and we built from there. 

All in all we got:
- CT Hollywood Flawless Filter in Fair No. 2
- CT The Queen of Glow Eyeshadow Palette 
- CT Cheek to Chic Swish and Pop Blusher in Ecstasy 
- CT Flimstar Bronze and Glow Contour and Highlighter Palette in Light - Medium
- CT 34 mL Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray
- CT Airbrush Bronzer in Medium No. 2
- Tarte Creaseless Concealer in 10B, fair beige

Total Cost $277 or $39.60ish per item 

So I've gathered Charlotte Tilbury is definitely on the pricier end of makeup, but I was honestly more concerned about the ""look,"" for the first major foray. 

She spent the better part of today picking out makeup with me and and teaching me how to do it. The only thing we didn't do were brows because: 1) my eyebrows need waxed badly, 2) we never found a good shade match, and 3) we ran out of time after six hours. We both had a blast and we agreed to meet up next weekend for brunch so yay for new friends. 

So, I know being a newbie my makeup won't last as long while I figure out the right amounts to dispense &amp; apply, etc., but roughly how fast should I be running through these products if I do M-F makeup application? I might be able to justify the pricing a bit more if the make up lasts longer than it looks in the tiny bottles. Are there any good Charlotte Tilbury dupes in the states? Most of what I've seen has been Primark."
1656197998,Makeup,any recommendations on how to keep your eyes from watering?,"I'm unsure if this is a personal medical issue, but this only happens when I apply eye makeup. Doing eye liner is difficult, I have hooded eyes so it usually smudges so to prevent that I go really close to the lash line but it makes my eyes water. The corner of my eyes (where you do 'wings' with eyeliner) is a really vulnerable spot too. Mascara is a hassle to do. Eyeshadow seems to be the safest, but rubs off easily due to my eyelids.

Applying lash adhesive and putting on eyelashes is the most hardest task. my eye shape is more rounded and the eyelashes I use tend to immediately fall off or not apply the right way no matter how hard I try.

I usually tend to avoid makeup tutorials because of my attention span, but if you have simple videos to recommend, much is appreciated."

...... 

➡️ NOTE: the information contained within this post is based upon my research, opinions, and experience. As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 

...... 

🔺️ PALETTE: Iconic London - Sunset to Sunrise Palette✌ 

...... 

🔺️ ACQUIRED: received in a BoxyCharm, of which I purchased myself 

...... 

🔺️ SELECTION RATIONALE: I've had this palette in my collection for quite a bit, but never really thoroughly explored it! I wanted to play with it a little bit today. 

...... 

👁 LOOK CREATED: 'Sunset Eye' 

...... 

▪️ PACKAGING &amp; DESIGN: each pan holds 1.6g of product, rectangular-shaped pans, rose gold mirrored chromatic cardboard packaging, bi-fold, palette brand is on cover, luxe-weight, magnetic closure system, square shape, mid-size mirror inside, tried a heavy magnet &amp; pans are NOT removable, shade nomenclature is designated to the immediate south of each shade 


🔊 NOTICE: 

+ At 1.6g, the shadows weigh ABOVE the average amount per pan. I don't think anybody would find difficulty in storing this palette. 

...... 

▪️ COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: this particular palette was made in China, but the version you purchase from their website is typically made in Italy 

...... 

▪️ TOTAL # OF SHADES: 20 (all eyeshadows, which are deemed safe by the FDA for use around the eye area). Upon further evaluation, NONE of the included shades stained my skin. 

...... 

▪️ TYPES OF FORMULAS: 2 formulas (8 mattes, 12 shimmers) 

...... 

▪️ DESIGNATION: warm color-story 

...... 

▪️ DEXTERITY CONCERNS: none 

...... 

▪️ DESCRIPTION OF SHADE PRESS: soft; recommend doing eyes before base with this palette.  

...... 

▪️ EXTRA PERTINENT INFORMATION: the creative inspiration behind this palette is the summer season, description states that there are 'glitters' in this palette, but I couldn't find any 

...... 

✅ ROUTINE DATA CHECK: 

+ not clarified as being a clean formula 
+ cruelty-free (PETA-certified)
+ vegan 
+ 12-month PAO (located on palette) 

...... 

🔍 COST EVALUATION: (Amazon) 

+ 💲 $19.86 / palette 
+ 💲 $0.99 / shade 
+ 💲 $0.62 / gram 

...... 

♦️ PRICE PER SHADE SCALE: 

+ &lt;$2=excellent; $3-$4=affordable; $5-$8=meh; $9-$15=expensive; &gt;$16=very expensive 


• Comparing this palette to similar products available on the market, the price-per-shade is 'extremely excellent'. Additionally - this palette has an 'amazing' cost-per-gram, as compared to other palettes I've previously reviewed. 

...... 

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️PATCHINESS: none 

🔸️CREASING: yes; almost immediately after look was completed 

🔸️STAINING: none 

🔸️BLENDABILITY: very easy to blend 

🔸️KICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 


+ the matte shades had an extraordinary level of kick-back, but not the shimmers
+ experienced a ton of fall-out 


🔸️COLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 


• this palette inholds the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always look for. The included shades range from light to midtone to deep. There is only one option available to create depth in your look, which drastically limits the palette's versatility (i.e., the types/amount of varying looks you can create) 


• realized that there was a lot of redundancy amongst the shimmers. The nuances between such minor shade subtleties are hardly noticeable in an overall look 


• there are a few neutral 'transition shades' included in this particular color-story. I am unsure how they will fare on a range on skintones


• the formula balance ratio in this palette is 8:12 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 40% / 60% formula split shows that it's leaning heavily 'shimmer-y'. I prefer either completely balanced layouts, OR matte-heavy


• I consider this to be a 'warm-toned' color-story, and it's not unique to my collection in the slightest. I do particularly like the entire layout of this palette 


• there is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'


• there were no 'dud' shades in this palette


• there is not any decorative embossing on any of the included shadows 

...... 

🔸️FORMULA EVALUATION: 

// 

🔹️ | MATTES |: 

+ the mattes are SUPER powdery in all aspects (I prefer a powdery formula)
+ some of the mattes have tiny pinpoint glitter specks in them, but they perform just as a normal matte shadow
+ I found this formula easy to blend
+ each color applied to my eyes the same as it appears as in the pan
+ this is a more 'buildable' formula (in lieu of being 'directly pigmented'), making it easier to manage and control the formula 

// 

🔹️ | SHIMMERS |: 

+ EXTREMELY cream-like in texture 
+ different levels of shimmers - some provide a slight shimmer, while others are intensely foiled 
+ there is both a mix of sheer &amp; pigmented bases - each shade is different 
+ attempted all application methods - my finger, a dry brush, &amp; a dampened brush. It worked exactly the same using all methods. 

...... 

🔸️PACKAGING: 


+ I am partial to the cosmetic look of mirrored chromatic packaging - ESPECIALLY that of the rose gold variety. This palette looks luxurious and expensive, and it feels that way in the hands 

+ I think this packaging is an excellent representation of the brand (Iconic London), as it is completely in-line with other products offered in their range and collection. 

...... 

🔸️COMMENTARY: guys, I'm having a REALLY hard time right now - I'm on 'Day 4' of my sugar detox, and I'm going through withdrawal from a very addictive medication all at the same time. I'm getting INTENSE headaches, feel immensely fatigued, feel dizzy af, and basically don't feel like doing anything. If you are reading this, and YOU are one of those people that really likes giving me a hard time over my eyeshadow looks - just let it pass gently today, okay? I'm suffering bad enough, and tried my best (given the circumstances). 

...... 

▪️FINAL RECOMMENDATION: (recommend) 

+ very easy to blend
+ fun and safe shade selection
+ beautiful display palette 

...... 

+ Favorite Shade: Summer Glow
- Least Favorite Shade: Ultraviolet 

...... 

🚦 RATING: B 

...... 

⭐ RATING LEGEND: 

+ A = totally wow'd me
+ B = not the best, but I like it
+ C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product
+ D = this didn't work out for me
+ F = I totally hate this

1. Are there any YouTube channels or something that you recommend for learning?
2. Where can I get decent makeup for somewhat cheap? I don't have much money (cons of being a teen lmao), but I have some. I would go to Walmart, but I saw a video that said Walmart was really bad for makeup
3. Where do I even start with makeup? I have basically no makeup, but there's just so many different things used for makeup Idek where to start
4. This isn't a question, but if anyone could tell me everything that I need to get started (idk, brushes or stuff?)
Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you!"

1656222369,Makeup,How do I prevent my base makeup from making my sebum more apparent?,"I was hoping to get some help with how I should be approaching base makeup application (or anything else that may be the root of this issue). I noticed that I'm never able to get a nice, uniform layer of foundation in the areas between my eyebrows, the sides of my nose, and my temples. Little sebum dots will always show through and they look worse than when I wasn't wearing any foundation at all.

I think I have combination skin since I form dry patches around my nose but the rest of my face gets pretty oily throughout the day. Lately, I have been using the elf poreless putty primer and the NARS radiant longwear foundation for my base; my skin prep before that is washing my face with the inkey list oat cleansing balm, lancome tonique confort hydrating facial toner, and then using the innisfree jelly cream. I have been using the ordinary's AHA + BHA peeling solution once a week for about 3 weeks now. I like to blend the foundation in using a beauty blender, and I did notice that the NARS foundation blends in slightly better—on occasion—when I use my hands, but I do get some streakiness from this application method too."

I have been using this foundation in the shade NATURAL for a while now. Unfortunately I can't find it anymore in my country. I tried a similar MaxFactor but is giving me acne and an Essence which has pink undertones.

1656249458,Makeup,I look ill without makeup even when well. What can I do?,"I know it's a common problem to look ill w/o makeup if you wear it very regularly, but I wear a full face of makeup once a week at most. Any other day I would wear maybe a lip product or eyeshadow, or nothing at all. Sometimes I just wear a full face because I'm bored or get tired of how ill I look and I want to jazz myself up. Some days I look fresh and glowy, but other ones (like today) my skin looks kind of grey, sallow and blotchy, and my lips are pale, for no apparent reason. I feel fine - I eat well, sleep enough, drink plenty of water and exercise. I also use retinoids on prescription as an acne treatment which have been exfoliating my skin. I'm not sure what could be going on. Might it be hormonal? 

Other than finding potential causes, is there a way to brighten up my face without using makeup, perhaps by a skincare technique or something else? Any advice is much appreciated."

But I think it would be a lot easier to apply if I had some black lipliner, and that's been hard to find. I have the MAC retro matte liquid lipstick in ""caviar"", and I started using the same brand's ""feline"" eyeliner as lipliner, which makes the lipstick a little smudgy.

So, I was wondering, does anyone have experience using black eyeliner as lipliner? Which brand is the best for that?"

I first ordered it in 2020 and love it, and recently ran out. I thought it was super cool that they sell a refill for the applicator, so I purchased that. The only problem is that I cannot for the life of me figure out how to actually refill it???

Has the cartridge changed in the last two years, making a new refill not compatible for the old applicator? Or am I just missing something?

I haven’t been able to find a tutorial on how to replace it anywhere TT_TT I feel so dumb but it’s my absolutely favorite foundation, and I’d really like to be able to use it!

1656264862,Makeup,How to prime and set cream-to-powder foundation,"I have oily, acne-prone skin and have had decent luck with cream foundations for full coverage in the past, so I'm probably going to buy a cream-to-powder foundation ([Milani Conceal + Perfect](https://www.ulta.com/p/conceal-perfect-smooth-finish-cream-powder-foundation-pimprod2012993) is the only one that I can find that isn't absurdly expensive). However, I don't know what kind of primer I should use under such a foundation and I especially don't know what I should use to set it. I'm concerned that powder on top of powder might dry out my skin and make it more oily (which has happened in the past), but also that setting spray might not ""set"" anything at all. Do any of you use cream-to-powder foundation and what do you use to set it?

Also, bonus question: can I use a beauty blender to apply the foundation? I had pretty good results with beauty blenders before, although that was with a CC cream/tinted moisturizer and not an actual foundation."
1656265258,Makeup,discontinued line,"Hey, so I own this lip liner, I have no idea how it came into my possession. It must have been a gift or something. But, it is my favorite lip liner and the color is just perfect. I cannot find another one like it, the thing is, I went to find it on the internet to see if I could buy another one but no search results for lip liners would come up, i'm not sure what happened to this brand and it seems like there's no answers online about it either. The name of the product is Rialto, the shade burnt terracotta. 

Although I am super bummed that I can't replace my favorite liner, I would still like to know about what happened to the brand, maybe they changed names or discontinued? I have no clue,

If anyone has any idea about this brand please let me know, I am curious :)"

1656269511,Makeup,(PLEASE HELP) Foundation recommendations for combination skin while using acne topicals,"**Backstory (feel free to skip to the bottom to get a quick summary):**

I have an extreme case of combination skin. My skin is acne-prone, very sensitive, dry (eczema), and oily (genetically). I've had a few dermatologists over the past decade, for my acne and eczema, and love the one I've been seeing for the past couple years. I've always used topical acne treatments at night but with the help of my current dermatologist I've also been using a daytime topical for acne.

Although I love the progress my skin has made while using a daytime topical, it has made my makeup look disgusting. **Literally disgusting**. Foundations refuse to stick to certain parts of my face, the makeup pills up on my jawline/hairline, my face looks cakey/patchy/dry. I only wear makeup once in a blue moon to feel more confident, but end up feeling insecure. 

**Does anyone know of any foundations that work well with acne topicals?** *Also here are the other skincare products I use before applying foundation: CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion, MDSolarSciences Mineral Cream SPF 50, Milk Hydro grip primer.*"
1656269514,Makeup,"Pale, blue eyes and light brown hair - struggling to find flattering lip products","I'm pale with blue eyes and light brown hair. I find it difficult to wear much colour on my lips as it doesn't seem to suit me, but after getting bored of wearing Dior Lip Glow everyday I thought I'd try buy a few lip products to experiment. 

I first bought the Mac Faux lipstick as it's cool toned and I'd seen it look really pretty on others with my kind of colouring, but on me it looks way too pale and pink. I then bought the Maybelline Lifter Gloss in the shade Petal and I like that colour if I sheer it out a little bit, but it has quite thick gold glitter in which I don't like. I was surprised I liked it as it's a little more red and darker then I thought I would like. I then bought the Nars Afterglow lip balm in Dolce Vita which I really like, again it's more of a red/rosy kind of colour but it seems to balance out my features and looks like my lips but better. I really like the way the Dolce Vita looks but I'm looking for someone with a little more pigment, ideally not matte.

Can anyone recommend me some other products to try are similar to Nars Dolce Vita Afterglow lip balm."
1656269847,Makeup,How to conceal dark spot on lips,"Hi guys. I have spot on the edge of my lip that causes that spot to be a noticeably darker shade of pink than the rest of my lips. 

I've tried to find tutorials on how to cover it up, but most just suggest putting skin-tone concealer on, which isn't really what I'm going for. I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how to cover up the mark and make it the same shade as the rest of my lips?"
1656269980,Makeup,Perfect Nudey-Brown Lipstick,"Hi everyone!! I'm looking for a brown in the nude family if that makes any sense, but I still want it to come across brown, not orange or pink. 

I'm extremely fair, literally think of the lightest shade in any foundation and that's me, with medium cool brown hair and grey eyes. Don't know if that matters but just in case. I have fairly neutral undertones that skew a tad on the warmer side. 

I've tried But First Coffee from the Sephora Collection and that one is okay but is a tad too warm I think. And I've tried NYX XXL Lip Lingerie in Goin Desnuda and that pulls so dark it looks black. 

Any suggestions? I would prefer a matte liquid lipstick but am open to other formulas if it's the right color."
1656272051,Makeup,"Hey ladies, can I stock up on mascaras and have them not dry out?",So I’ve found a German brand (Catrice) that makes great and cheap mascaras which I wanted to stock up on. Only I am wondering if I can buy several of them and store them unopened without them drying out?
1656273958,Makeup,Should I be wearing foundation to protect my skin?,"Before the pandemic I was wearing foundation basically every day (usually Too Faced's Born This Way). But once I stopped needing to go out I thought I'd give my skin a break. At first my skin hated it! I was breaking out more than ever and couldn't tie it to doing anything different other than not wearing foundation. But after a transition period I felt like my skin was consistently clearer than ever. When I started to occasionally go out again and put on foundation, after removing it I felt like my skin looked even more dull and gray than before putting the make up on, even though I carefully removed all of it. 

I now wear a tinted sunscreen in place of foundation. I thought not wearing foundation would just be better for my skin. But I've have read online that wearing a layer of make-up/foundation can help protect against damage from free radicals, pollution, sun, etc. Are these claims true? 

I recently turned 30 and want to up my skincare game, so I'm debating whether incorporating foundation back into my routine would be better for my skin if I'm wearing one with clean ingredients and removing it properly. On the other hand it's been nice not to deal with since I hate the feeling of foundation and the look of anything other than very light coverage. I've also considered BB or CC creams instead but I have tried so many brands and they all break me out or sit weirdly on my skin. Any advice on this?"

1656276055,Makeup,Advice for Mature Skin + Hyperpigmentation,"When working on mature, aging skin with sun damage, hyperpigmentation, dark spots etc. it always helps to substitute full coverage products for color correcting. Always prep skin well, and apply a color complementary to the shade of the blemish you want to neutralize, before foundation. It's helpful if your corrector has built-in coverage, like the graftobian glamour creme corrector palettes. (they come in a fair, and deep color way). If you still require more coverage after correction, try using a full coverage creme pigment like the kevyn aucoin sensual skin enhancer, only over the areas you've corrected. I did bridal makeup on a mature client recently and utilized these techniques, then applied a medium coverage, natural dewy finish foundation on top (dior forever skin glow). This ensured that her skin was perfected but that the glam looked flattering in most lighting. you can also build coverage when setting the face, by setting with a foundation powder i.e. mac studio fix powder, onesize turn up the base powder, urban decay stay naked the fix, etc."

When I was a preteen, I over plucked my  brows because I wanted them to look like Jenna Fischer's (Pam) in season 1 of The Office. It has been tragic ever since. My brows have never fully grown back. The tails of my brows are almost non existent, and they are thinner than they should be because I severely over plucked them on the bottom. 

This being said, I have to fill them in every day in order to look normal. But because of how sparse they are, I'm always way too heavy handed. My brows hairs naturally grown downard, and it's literally not possible for me to make them ""stand up"" (like feather brows). I've tried pencils, pomades, and powders, and yet my brows always come out too dark because of how much product I need to use in order to get a clean shape. 

Looking at childhood photos of myself,  my natural brows appear grey-colored compared to my black hair. And that seemed to suit my face a lot more. I'm wondering if there's a brown product out there that can help me achieve that same affect, i.e. light in color but pigmented enough for me to get a clean shape on my sparse brows.

Her names Courtney hollins, aka Centre of attention make up artisty.
Let me begin by saying i liked her, I liked how she'd say things, being from New Zealand it's cool to see a auzzy getting up there, she had good product reviews, all around she's a little rough around the edges but that's just the kiwi auzzy personalitys.
The other night Courtney makes a post, with a screen cap of someone's Facebook for all of her followers to see (low-key really wishing is screenshoted her post myself kinda hoping maybe one off you have 😅) she's calling this lady out for commenting shitty stuff on her posts and just being a generalized menace.
So i commented, jist of my comment was the post was shitty and you don't know what crazies follow you, pretty much immediately the post gets taken down, which was the optimal outcome imo.
But that's not quite what happened, the post got reported until it got taken down, and then Courtney did a live stream, explaining why she blocked everyone who didn't agree with her posting someone's Facebook account for all off her followers to see. So to her, just because she's got a following why does that mean she's not aloud to stick up for herself? (Which i agree with, stand up for yourself, don't post screencaps knowing full well your minions are about to go harass ol aunty dolmio yaknow.) 
The entire problem, is not the the fact she stood up for herself, it's that she thinks she's done nothing wrong in this situation.
So im asking myself why im writing this, and the entire reason is keep an eye on this girl, she's going to be the next Jeffree Star.

1656534076,Makeup,Looking for a specific lipstick by L’Oreal from many years ago,"My mum is looking for this lipstick she was gifted many years ago that consisted of two tubes joined together next to each other. One tube had a coloured lipstick and the other had a hydrating and clear sort of lip balm. If I remember correctly, the coloured side also had a coloured tube while the clear side was a silver tube. It’s possible it was travel size so maybe the packaging looked different on the full size one.

She loved the lipstick because it wouldn’t smudge. It was sort of like a liquid lipstick but the look and consistency of it was more like a regular lipstick. She doesn’t have the old packaging anymore so I’m having trouble trying to find it. All I know is that it was by L’Oreal. 

My mum would like to purchase it because she has a wedding to attend and it used to be her fave lipstick, but I don’t even know if they still make it.

Both liquid liner and eyelash glue have 1 thing in common: they go on wet and then dry. The drying is what kills me. My eyes are already way too dry they don't need to be dryer. 

I use crayon or pencil eyeliners instead (urban decays is my fav its so soft!!) But I've used brands like Tarte, Urban Decay, etc.

My thing is bc of my medical conditions sometimes my eyelashes are uneven (like super noticeable uneven) and I would like to put on small falsies when that happens....issue is the eyelash glue or liquid magnetic liners.

So does anyone know of magnetic eyeliner that is a cream kind of base like the tarte or urban decay eyeliners?

1656612006,Makeup,Good eyelash curler that can properly curl lashes?,"A few months ago I lost my beloved eyelash curler. It was one of the best ones I’ve used and I had it for a long time. I’m pretty upset I lost it. I believe it was a Revlon curler. Ever since then, every other eyelash curler - even the new Revlon ones I’ve bought - haven’t created that same effect of curling my lashes the way I liked before, despite it being the exact same curler. With the new curler, I press down and clamp like I usually do, but it hardly curls them and they’re still sticking mostly down. Or if is curled, it’s awkwardly curled and clumped together.

I’m wondering if this is due to the eyelash curler pads being brand new and not “worn down”. When they’re new, they don’t curl my lashes properly. Whereas if it’s been used and “indented” over time, it makes my lashes way better. I read a suggestion that said to keep using the new one to wear it down, but I don’t like it in the meantime, plus I tried waiting and I haven’t seen much improvement. This frustrates me as I have decently long eyelashes that would curl up perfectly with my old curler, and I make sure to clamp and hold and look down for awhile while curling them, and it does nothing. Should I try a new curler? Any recommendations?"

During this process, I'm also figuring out which products I'm completely decluttering from my collection. 

...... 

🔹️POTENTIAL PROCESS QUESTIONS: 


+ Total Products This Month: 23
+ Total Products I'm Keeping: 15
+ Total Products I'm Decluttering: 5
+ Total Products Finished: 3
+ Total Products on 'Repurchase' List: 2
+ % of Routine Finished/Decluttered: 35% 


• DECLUTTERED PRODUCTS: will be placed in a special box for the time being as I collect more, but I intend on gathering a few more over time, and selling (the ones I paid for) as a bundle for solely the cost of shipping on my boutique. The products that I got for free (or don't have time to list) will be bundled together and I will hold a bundle giveaway for people who don't mind (sanitized) secondhand products used only by me. 


• PROS OF THIS SYSTEM: significant product knowledge, ability to get intensively creative with products, easy to manage such a small grouping of products, no hard decisions on what makeup to wear every day, means to actually use up products (or make a pretty big dent)


• CONS OF THIS SYSTEM: boredom (I got notably bored at the three-week mark), if something you pick really sucks - you have to explore ways to make it work in other capacities, sadness of potentially decluttering something you spent a lot of money on if it doesn't perform

// 

▪️EYESHADOW PALETTE: Violet Voss - Windflower Palette • this is quite the reddish-toned palette, and I had to get creative with it to really diversify my looks. The good thing was that the feat was VERY easy to do, given the vehement shade versatility. Everything blended-out super-well, and I was very happy with most of the looks that I got out of it. This has the more 'powdery' formula that I just love, but the negative aspect of such a formula is that you use up quite a lot of product FAST! I've been using this palette consistently for a month, and I've made a big dent into it. I didn't uncover any 'dud' shades in here, every shade worked spectacularly well. For such a precise-toned palette, I was impressed by its dynamism. 


+ 🕶 SHADE: n/a
+ 💲 PRICE: $18.00 (sephora)
+ 🔹️ ACQUIREMENT: purchased myself 
+ 🔆 FINAL DECISION: keeping 

...... 

▪️EYE PRIMER: Alamar Cosmetics - Pero Primero, Primer! • over the course of the month, I've had many opportunities to attempt this primer in various ways. The thing is - NO MATTER which way I used it, it was horrible. Let's talk about the good features, first - it's slightly tinted so it does a little bit for discoloration, and a little bit goes a long way. That's about it. On the contrary, it almost immediately gathered into my creases, broke apart in essential areas, and was extremely patchy by nature. It retained a 'tacky' finish, making the task of blending eyeshadow nearly impossible. Basically - no matter which way I used there was NO saving this, and I could NOT get it to work for me. I rely on a decent eye primer, so this was disappointing. 


+ 🕶 SHADE: n/a
+ 💲 PRICE: $11.99 (amazon)
+ 🔹️ ACQUIREMENT: purchased myself
+ 🔆 FINAL DECISION: decluttering 

...... 

▪️FOUNDATION: Garnier - SkinActive BB 5-in-1 Miracle Skin Perfector • oh, where do I even start with this product? It is the EXACT opposite of all of its claims. It offers ZERO coverage (albeit a heavy, greasy application), only exists in one (maybe two) shades, doesn't pair well with ANY other products, gives an EXTREMELY dewy and wet finish (NOT for oily/combo skin), and looks simply awful on the skin by the end of the day. This is the WORST $12 I've ever spent on a makeup product, and I respectfully IMPRESS upon you to never buy this. I can't tell you how many times I've worn this and absolutely despised the look of my skin afterward. This actually, legitimately makes my skin look worse-off, than wearing nothing at all. 


+ 🕶 SHADE: light/medium
+ 💲 PRICE: $12.00 (amazon)
+ 🔹️ ACQUIREMENT: purchased myself 
+ 🔆 FINAL DECISION: decluttering 

...... 

▪️MASCARA: Blinc - Ultravolume Tubing Mascara • this mascara isn't 'perfect', but it's damn good. I LOVE the way it makes my eyelashes look in a simple two-coat application. There's really nothing special or unique about the brush itself, but the formula is outstanding. It's a very deep, pitch-black color that truly provides acute dimension for the ultimate 'false-lash-effect' look. This mascara gives me DRAMATIC volume, length, and curl - everything I look for in a mascara. It's also incredibly easy to remove - it comes off with just a little warm water (since it's a tubing formula). However, what makes it particularly 'imperfect' is that I JUST got this mascara one or two months ago, and at this point in time - it's unusable. The formula hardened up around the cap, making it very difficult to open. It also comes out a little 'drier and clumpier' than I prefer. Although it doesn't last very long, it looks SO amazing that I would definitely be tempted to buy this again, provided the situation of needing a new mascara. 


+ 🕶 SHADE: 01 black
+ 💲 PRICE: $26.00 (sephora)
+ 🔹️ ACQUIREMENT: received in a subscription box, of which I purchased myself 
+ 🔆 FINAL DECISION: repurchase list 

...... 

▪️CONCEALER: Covergirl - Clean Invisible Concealer • no - just no. I've NEVER hated a concealer more, honestly. The funny thing is that Covergirl makes one of my favorite concealers (the Undercover Concealer), yet this formula is drastically different in all constructs. At the beginning of the month, I had confidence in it, but that really faded fast. This concealer offers ZERO coverage at all. It doesn't work well under the eyes OR for spot concealing. It doesn't work with a brush, sponge, or finger. There is simply NO point to applying this in any capacity. Oh, and if you SLIGHTLY have a water-y lashline? The concealer IMMEDIATELY goes patchy and removes itself, especially by the tear-duct area. This just looked awful on my skin in general, and I don't recommend it AT ALL. 


+ 🕶 SHADE: light pale
+ 💲 PRICE: $5.12 (walmart) 
+ 🔹️ ACQUIREMENT: purchased myself 
+ 🔆 FINAL DECISION: decluttering 

...... 

▪️EYE SINGLE: r.e.m. beauty - Metallic Gel Eyeshadow • a little fact about me is that I'm hopelessly mesmerized by ANYTHING that r.e.m. beauty launches. I tell myself I'm not interested, and the next thing I know - I'm DYING to try their newest launch. Not sure why I'm such a fanatic for the brand. Anyway, I saw this - and...it's so me! I HAD to try it. Unfortunately, this was absolutely AWFUL. It was such a nightmare to use it this month. It has a 'gel' formula that is resistant to both a brush AND your finger, and if you get lucky enough to score an adequate amount of product to apply - it just has the WORST application. It goes on ultra patchy, and dries too quickly for you to do anything about it. I've tried building it up by heavily packing it on AND using it as a sheer wash - nothing worked. It always looked uneven, patchy, and flaky. I love the general concept and color of this product, but I DEFINITELY do not like this type of eyeshadow formula in the slightest. 


+ 🕶 SHADE: touch
+ 💲 PRICE: $16.00 (ulta)
+ 🔹️ ACQUIREMENT: purchased myself 
+ 🔆 FINAL DECISION: decluttering 

...... 

✌ AFTERTHOUGHTS: 


▪️WAS ANYTHING MISSING FROM MY ROUTINE? not this month! 


▪️DID I FEEL AS IF I HAD A SURPLUS AMOUNT OF ANY CATEGORY? no 


▪️DID I MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE INITIAL MAKEUP ROUTINE SELECTION? I misplaced the 'LA Girl Cosmetics - Shady Slim Brow Pencil' somewhere on week 3, but I loved every second of using it. If I cannot find it, it is something I would CERTAINLY repurchase in the future, given the need. 


▪️WHAT THINGS 'DON'T COUNT'? I don't necessarily include various colored eyeliners (I pick one to focus on for the month, but I'm not limited to ONLY that one for every look), lip pencils, assistance mascaras, lashes, or skin prep items

i’ve put on fake lashes myself maybe about 8 times in the past month and i’ve managed but the way it turns out is like it looks fine if you don’t look super close, but if you do, you can tell it’s too far above my lash line. for some reason, my right eye is way easier to apply than my left (im right handed) but i just can’t seem to get it right without like 3 tries, especially on my left eye. and even then, it’s not exactly “right” it’s just good enough ig. i’ve angled my mirror downwards too. idk what i’m doing wrong but i rly need help"

I have full coverage concealer because I want to make my imperfections less noticeable (mostly acne and dark spots).  I have read that people usually apply foundation before concealer, so I bought some of that too.

Up until now, I always put on foundation before concealer because I assumed that I was supposed to.  The articles that I read say that foundation is needed to provide a base for other makeup.  However, I am starting to wonder if I really need that base because I have seen some women wear concealer without foundation, and their faces looked great.

Should I keep putting on foundation before concealer?  Or am I just adding a pointless extra step to my makeup routine?  What are the benefits of putting on foundation first?"

I have recently been looking into face powder alternatives that do not contain talc. I wanted to get something that was preferably a pressed powder and I have finally found something I wanted to try, however the product contains “quartzstone”. I know that quartzstone and silica are related and that makeup products contain a form of silica called hydrated silica that does not allow for silicosis. Should I be concerned about this product since it lists quartzstone instead of silica/hydrated silica? The product is Flower Goddess Pressed Setting Powder by the Chinese brand Flowers Know. Here is the full ingredient list, any info is appreciated:

QUARTZSTONE, TRIETHOXYOCTYLSILANE, SYNTHETIC FLUORPHLOGOPITE, MAGNESIUM MYRISTATE, CETYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, ZINC OXIDE, HYDROXYAPATITE, HDI/TRIMETHYLOLHEXYLLACTONE CROSSPOLYMER, BORON NITRIDE, TRIETHOXYOCTYLSILANE, DIMETHICONE/ VINYL DIMETHICONE CROSSPOLYMER, GLYCEROL, POLYSORBATE-60, SQUALANE, WATER, PHYDROXYACETOPHENONE, 2-OCTYLDODECYL 12-[(1OXOOCTADECYL) OXY]OCTADECANOATE, CARRAGEENAN ( CHONDRUS CRISPUS ), POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, CHLORPHENESIN TOCOPHEROL ACETATE"

💄 Monthly Makeup Routine Reviews • May, '22 

...... 

➡️ NOTE: the information contained within this post is based upon my research, opinions, and experience. As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 

...... 

🧐 PURPOSE: every month I'm shopping my stash for ONE product from each makeup category. Over the course of the month, I'm going to really get to learn about each product in-depth, and eventually relay to you, the findings. During this process, I'm also figuring out which products I'm completely decluttering from my collection. 

...... 

🔹️POTENTIAL PROCESS QUESTIONS: 

+ Total Products This Month: 16
+ Total Products I'm Keeping: 11
+ Total Products I'm Decluttering: 3
+ Total Products I'm Repurchasing: 1
+ % of Routine Fully Used/Decluttered: 25% 


• DECLUTTERED PRODUCTS: will be placed in a special box for the time being as I collect more, but I intend on gathering a few more over time, and selling (the ones I paid for) as a bundle for solely the cost of shipping on my boutique. The products that I got for free will be bundled together and I will hold a bundle giveaway for people who don't mind (sanitized) secondhand products used only by me. 


• PROS OF THIS SYSTEM: significant product knowledge, ability to get intensively creative with products, easy to manage such a small grouping of products, no hard decisions on what makeup to wear every day, means to actually use up products (or make a pretty big dent)


• CONS OF THIS SYSTEM: boredom (I got notably bored at the three-week mark), if something you pick really sucks - you have to explore ways to make it work in other capacities, sadness of potentially decluttering something you spent a lot of money on if it doesn't perform 

......

🔔 SELECTED REVIEWS (full reviews on each product used + a complete 'try-on' are already uploaded on my YouTube channel) 


▪️PRIMER: Veil Cosmetics - Sunset Light Primer Serum • this is such an interesting and unique type of bottle; I love how satisfying it is to see exactly how much I've been using. Each time I've used this, I've found that three pumps was the perfect amount. This primer has absolutely no scent. It gives my skin the most PERFECT sunlit glow - it looks like a strong luminous primer without having any sparkly chunks or obnoxious shine. This primer has worked perfectly along with every other product I've used alongside it. It immediately absorbs into my skin and provides for a very smooth finish without that silicone-like, slippery feeling. 


🕶 SHADE: n/a 

💲 PRICE: $48.95 (veil cosmetics) 

🔹️ ACQUIREMENT: gratefully received as PR 

🔆 FINAL DECISION: keeping 

...... 

▪️EYE PRIMER: Sample Beauty - Erase &amp; Boost Base • the best thing about this is that you get a MEGA amount in the pot! Unfortunately, it smells like baby powder - but the scent doesn't translate once you actually apply it. I used to LOVE this when I first got it, but the more I've been using it - my disdain has grown. On the good side, just a little teeny bit goes such a long way, it fully color corrects any harsh discoloration, and it truly provides for a full-coverage base. Sadly, as I apply it, it starts going on 'patchy', and leaving some spots more hydrated and others very, very dry - making for the shadows on top to look very odd and uneven. ALSO - this primer severely creases on me. 


🕶 SHADE: 3 

💲 PRICE: $2.46 (beauty bay) 

🔹️ ACQUIREMENT: purchased myself 

🔆 FINAL DECISION: declutter 

...... 

▪️CONCEALER: The Crème Shop - Full Coverage Concealer • off the top, this has a HORRIBLE, barely tolerable, strong paint-like scent to it. Every time I utilized it like a 'normal' undereye concealer - it LOOKED extremely flawless, but it burned the hell out of my eyes and caused them to turn red and severely water. After narrowing it down to THIS product, I completely stopped using it as an undereye concealer, but found it looks absolutely magical when used as a foundation base product OR as a facial spot concealer. As a foundation base, I apply a few 'x's' all over my face, and it blends-out flawlessly with a brush. It gives me the perfect coverage, and it doesn't look heavy or cakey in the least! As a spot concealer, it works wonders and lasts all day long. I do enjoy setting it with a bit of powder, as it does have a bit of a tacky-feeling. 


🕶 SHADE: light 

💲 PRICE: $5.98 (amazon) 

🔹️ ACQUIREMENT: purchased myself 

🔆 FINAL DECISION: keeping 

...... 

▪️SETTING POWDER: OPV Beauty - Loose Setting Powder • overall, I just haven't had any luck with this powder whatsoever. I've tried every possible way to apply it - with a sponge, a large fluffy brush, a more precise flimsy brush, and a velour puff. No matter which way I apply it, the final result is always a heavy, cakey, messy look that creases on me, making my face look several years older. This powder collects into my most porous areas on my face, giving me a white-cast that doesn't disappear. On a good note, there's no scent to it, and the plastic dispenser partition is excellent in its construction. I love the IDEA of this powder, but its actual performance has been less-than-impressive. 


🕶 SHADE: translucent

🔆 FINAL DECISION: decluttering 

...... 

▪️EYESHADOW PALETTE: Revolution Beauty - Reloaded • the more I've used this over the course of the month, the more I've been ABSOLUTELY loving it. It has served as a multipurpose product for the eyes, lips, and face. After getting creative with it, I was able to pull-off some of the shades as amazing face and lip products. The shades and textures incororated into this palette are so excellent - I cannot believe people are skipping on this! I seriously want to buy more 'Reloaded' palettes to see if the formula is consistent throughout the range. Each eye look that I've done with it, I have truly loved, and have had so much fun with. I was able to get a quick and easy look OR take it to the extreme with a dramatic, fancy look. You get a great shade selection in here, and some very interesting effects. This was my most-favorite piece that I've experienced all month long. The only 'con' I would like to make note of, is that the saturated black ink on the front of the palette has begun to rub off onto my hands, causing me angst. 


🕶 SHADE: prestige 

💲 PRICE: $8.00 (ulta beauty) 

🔹️ ACQUIREMENT: purchased myself 

🔆 FINAL DECISION: keeping 

...... 

▪️BROWS: Iconic London - Brow Silk • this is such an interesting product, and I truly believe it to be one of the pioneer products for many of the similar ones we see on the market today. I found it best to use this BEFORE I did any of my other makeup, as the wax would remove any foundation around the brow area. As per the instructions - I tried using it both wet and dry, and preferred its operational ability when the wax was in its dry state. I used its companion 'toothbrush-looking tool', and I also attempted to use the wax with a spoolie. Overall, the 'toothbrush-tool' was much more effective with this particular formula. I initially applied the wax by back-combing my brow and ensuring the wax fully and evenly coated the entire eyebrow. Then, I went for the feathery look, and fluffed my eyebrow up a pinch. After I was done applying the rest of my makeup, both eyebrows totally fell. This wax doesn't have ANY hold to it at all. Upon touch, my brows felt very waxy and almost wet. I wouldn't recommend this for any sort of 'laminated look' - in fact, I wouldn't recommend this at all.

✌ AFTERTHOUGHTS: 


+ WAS ANYTHING MISSING FROM MY ROUTINE? yes; a setting spray, a color-corrector, and a pore-filling primer 


+ DID I FEEL AS IF I HAD A SURPLUS AMOUNT OF ANY PRODUCT? no 


+ DID I MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE INITIAL MAKEUP ROUTINE SELECTION? yes; I added a highlighter on 'Week 3' as I completely forgot to initially include one. I don't have quite enough knowledge on the formula to extensively review it. 


+ WHAT THINGS 'DON'T COUNT'? I don't necessarily include various colored eyeliners (I pick one to focus on for the month, but I'm not limited to ONLY that one for every look), lip pencils, assistance mascaras, lashes, prep items, or lip plumpers

i love NYX and they have some cute ones (i have their white, fuchsia metal, lilac, sapphire epic wear liners + the vivid bright baby pink and vivid fire!)- but i want to find a wide range of bright or pastel ones! 
i bought CmaaDU’s 10 pack (i think) of liners from amazon. i love them but once they dry, they sometimes will start to peel or i have to put on a few layers b/c they can look streaky.

1653716661,Makeup,Foundation recs for hotter weather?,"Hi all,

Does anyone have any recommendations for foundation now that it's getting warmer here in the US? It could be foundation, bb cream, skin tint or whatever. I've been interested in Giorgio Armani silk foundation, Fenty eaze skin tint, and Nars light reflecting.

I have big pores and oily skin. Mild acne that comes and goes but not a major concern. I mainly look for something that just helps even out my skin color and can really last all day. 

I've been using Estee Lauder's double wear but I'm not sure why lately (now that it's warmer... I'm guessing it might be due to weather?) when I've been doing my foundation and then setting it with my usual Laura Mercier translucent powder, it gets patchy, ugly and doesn't blend well. The patchiness also happened today when I tried setting my face after using Missha's red tube BB cream. Anyone know why? I like using setting powder since I don't like that sticky feeling from wet foundation on my face. Would changing to setting spray be better? I've been looking into getting Urban Decay's all nighter after seeing many posts recommending that. How long does it take for the UD setting spray to dry down your face so it's not wet/sticky?

Do people just deal with the sticky feeling on their face? How long does your makeup take to dry down  in general?

What else could I change in my routine to stop the patchiness from happening? I take good care of my skin daily so I don't think it's a problem with skincare.

On a side note, somewhat related... Does anyone know why good coverage of SPF is not common in western beauty? In Kbeauty there's always atleast 30+SPF in all their face base products. I was just thinking maybe it would be nice to find a foundation that also has SPF already so I know it will mix well with each other."

1653748916,Makeup,Seeking Opinions: Similar product finish to E.L.F. Matte Eyeshadow (liquid),"The finish of e.l.f.'s matte eyeshadow (link to a Walmart listing below) was \~perfection\~. I have been seeking a liquid to matte finish eyeshadow, and have been very disappointed with market options. The o.g. is discontinued, active listings I highly suspected are old/expired and are more than the original MSRP.  

Things I have tried:

* E.L.F No Budge Shadow Stick - I think it doesn't apply easily and doesn't have the same finish.
* E.L.F. Shadow Lock Eyelid Primer - I find that this creases and does not work well with shadows overtop (turns colors gray and prevents quality blending)
* E.L.F. Liquid Glitter- Fine, but no matte option
* Ulta Brand  Matte Cream Eyeshadow - doesn't have the same quality finish once it dries and shadows do not blend well over top
* M.A.C. Pro Longwear Paint Pot Eyeshadow - for the price point, I still prefer the E.L.F. and not impressed with the dry down and how shadows work overtop
* Wet N Wild Megalast Liquid Catsuit Creme Eyeshadow - doesn't have the same quality finish once it dries and shadows do not blend well over top

1653828694,Makeup,Foundation makes me look old!,"Hi everyone, 💕

does anyone else have the problem that foundation is making them look old? 🤯😤

I am female and just turned 40. I would say, in general, I don’t look older than I am. I never smoked, I don’t drink, I avoid the sun and I always wear SPF 50, all the year round. Also, I would say I eat quite healthy.

I don’t use makeup on a daily basis anymore (currently on parental leave); mostly I only use moisturiser and sunscreen; sometimes a slightly tinted sunscreen on top. 

For some special occasions, I still like to wear some makeup. But lately I found that it makes me look soooo old - much older than I look without it imho. 

The problem is that my skin is very sensitive and lacks moisture, but at the same time it tends to get a bit oily, so I need to use powder to set the foundation, and I feel this is what is making me look old: the foundation &amp; powder collect in my wrinkles and make them appear more prominent than they seem without makeup. 

What can I do? I am just using the wrong products? 

As I said already, my skin is very sensitive. I have rosacea and can’t tolerate scented skincare products, and products that contain a lot of alcohol, since they will irritate my skin. I feel, this makes everything quite complicated, because most foundations contain perfume and/or alcohol. 

But maybe someone is in the same boat as me and has the ultimate recommendation which products might actually work? 

Thanks a lot in advance! ☀️"

I then switched to swing and pretty much went with little to no makeup then too. Then with the pandemic and wearing masks, I didn’t even bother as I found the makeup under the mask getting smeared into my face while no one was going to see it anyway seemed silly. 

I finally got a day shift position this year. I have felt the need to start wearing makeup again. I’ve been pretty excited about eyeshadow and lipstick even though I mostly feel I have no idea what I’m doing. I try watching eyeshadow tutorials but I’m mostly just very confused. 

Anyway, what I’ve noticed is that I find foundation and face powder extremely uncomfortable now when years ago I hated my skin so much that face powder was my favorite. I am wondering if it’s seen as inappropriate to wear just eye makeup (shadow and mascara or sometimes just mascara) and lipstick/lipgloss? Do people notice?

I have medium/tan warm skintone and after a few minutes of applying product on my face it turns darker and Orange around my chin. 

I have tried several primer and foundation /tint/concealer combos and I always look like I applied a self tanner on my face.

I bought a foundation mixing pigment that will lighten my foundation, so that once it oxidizes I was hoping it will be close to my skin color, but the problem is how orange my skin (especially my chin)  gets.

I’m also debating on buying foundations or tints that are 2 shades lighter, so that when it oxidize it will be closer to my skin color???

Most eyeshadow palettes are divided into three color categories: light, medium, and dark shades.

* The light shades should be applied to your brow bone and the inner corner of your eyes in the same way that our favorite highlighters are applied to the tops of your features. 
* Medium shades are the key players in your eyeshadow palette. They can be used to build and create any makeup look, depending on how dramatic you want to be.
* For the perfect cut crease that gives the illusion of giant eyes, outline a V in the crease of your eye with the darkest colors

**How to Apply Eyeshadow Palettes to Get a Natural Look?**

1. Apply an eyeshadow primer
2. Create your foundation

- There isn’t a wide shade range, likely because it’s not a full coverage foundation 
- The texture is very sticky and whipped. It’s almost looks like yogurt 
- It must be blended out with your fingers or a brush. My sponge would literally NOT work because it’s so sticky.
- It’s described as a moisture balm with ‘buildable light-medium coverage’. Honestly after applying I saw…nothing. No coverage at all. When trying to build and apply more it simply would not blend into my skin due to the odd texture. My tinted sunscreen has better coverage than this foundation. 
- It’s $44 which is on the higher end, especially for a balm not a foundation. 

Conclusions: DONT buy it. I tried with an open mind and it’s not a good product in my opinion. 

Would love to hear others opinions or tips if I’m not using it correctly!"

1653925702,Makeup,Oily skincare tips in summer for your glowing skin -," Summers come with brighter, longer days and unwelcome sweaty feelings. Along with temperature, the moisture situation also peaks. These certain environmental changes are indeed more problematic if you have unctuous skin. Not sure about your skin type, also find out then. Summers may spark your sebaceous glands to produce further oil painting on your skin, giving you an unwanted candescent look and flights. Yes, the overproduction of sebum mingled with sweat can lead to unattractive acne flights and fully squinch your makeup. So, gear up to prepare your skin for summer 2021.

Unctuous skin and summers are not a veritably good combination, you have to be more careful about your skin. Revising your skincare routine and streamlining your beauty closet with the stylish summer skincare products for unctuous skin that actually watch for your unctuous skin should be your ultimate beauty thing this summer!

Before we reveal what to do and what to avoid let us begin by unveiling colorful skin enterprises that you may encounter in the summer season if you have unctuous skin!"
1653926770,Makeup,foundation recommendations?,"I’m looking for a new foundation to try. I was using Ilia super serum or the Revolution conceal and define foundation. 

Lately I’ve been getting more acne after getting off the pill, so I’d like something more on the full coverage side. I was thinking Charlotte Tilbury, Nars, or Rare Beauty. Maybe Georgio Armani if I’m willing to splurge a little. 

Ideally, I don’t want it to be super mattifying, simply because it dries out my skin and makes me look cakey. (Even my boyfriend told me my skin looked cakey lmao)

What’s your fave tinted moisturizers? Bonus points for large shade range (my undertones are super finicky.) I love a blurring effect that stays put, but doesn’t highlight every dry flake on my nose. Very much a fan of the “my skin but better” concept. Thank you in advance!"

I'm in search of a mascara that I can wear pain-free.

\- I am a 25 year old **contact lense** wearer, but I usually don't wear contacts all day because my eyes get **itchy and dry**. I wasn't even able to wear contacts since I was 16 because they itched so badly, but taking a daily fish oil supplement and drinking tons of water a day helped me.  
\- My problem is eyes + mascara = ITCH, my eyes itch 5 minutes after putting on any mascara and I have to go wash it all off ASAP. Redness, allergies, or watery eyes are not a concern for me.  
\- Preference: Would like a really obvious mascara look, not those natural looking ones. Waterproof or regular, as long as it doesn't smudge ridiculously. 

Anyone out there have a similar, itchy, experience, with their eyeballs? Anybody have found a mascara that doesn't cause itching?

1654016363,Makeup,Dark red tinted lip balm?,"Hey y'all,

I haven't worn makeup except for special occasions since the pandemic hit, but when I was in high school/early college I used to do my makeup for class (or at least try to). I was always pretty bad at it, though, and always either looked overly ""made up"" or like I didn't try at all with no in between. I'm a brown-skinned black woman, so pink and coral shades don't look good on me- it seems like the only lip colors I can wear are deep red or dark plum, which are obviously really ""made up"" looking. The only way I could get around this was by using a tinted lip balm so that the pigment was *there* but not overpowering.

Now the masks are coming off and I'm going back to school in the fall, so I want to start wearing makeup again. I found [this face palette](https://www.revolutionbeauty.us/tammi-golden-hour-deep-dark-face-palette/12657092.html) from Revolution Beauty and am looking for a tinted lip balm or gloss that's in the same dark reddish-brown shade as the blush.

1654019054,Makeup,BB cream making my face orange,"I’m an early 30’s female and I’ve recently started wearing makeup on a daily basis and I’m noticing my BB cream is making my face look more orange than I would like. I like that the Bb cream seems to even my skin tone and give a good base, but it also makes it quite a bit more orange or “tan” than the rest of my skin and I end up with a sharp contrast line on my chin. I switched from Covergirl Bb cream to L’Oréal Bb cream and I’m using the lightest shade available but it still seems to be a pretty intense contrast. I’m very pale so I’ve had trouble in the past finding light enough foundation that I didn’t end up being too dark compared to the rest of my skin. So basically my question is, Why does this happen with the Bb cream and how can I fix it? Are all Bb creams this way? Do I just need a lighter shade? Any brand suggestions? Any advice is appreciated!!"

1654037919,Makeup,Bronzing technique is not meant for certain skin types,"I recently booked an appointment with a MUA in my local area so that I could see how a professional applies makeup on me. I was getting quite bored with my everyday makeup and wanted to see if it could be elevated. After applying my base makeup she went straight to blush/highlight but I was slightly confused because I'm used to applying bronzer and a bit of contour to add depth to my face. 

I asked her if she would be bronzing/contouring and she said no because certain techniques just don't work on certain skin tones. She said because my skin is dark (NC50/similar to Nia Long) there really isn't a need to bronze or contour because it doesn't really do anything for my skin.

 I've always found that Mocha Mami by Fenty adds colour and depth to my face so I was a bit surprised that she doesn't believe in adding contour or bronzer to deeper skin. Is this a normal practice for MUA's when working on deeper skin? Does bronzing/contouring not really do anything for deeper skin? This is my first time working with a MUA. I definitely learned a lot but this was my first time learning that bronzing/contouring isn't the best technique for deeper skin. Is there a better way to add depth to the face?

1650976657,Makeup,"Contour looks patchy, please help!!","I'd say I have some experience with makeup, but no matter what I do I can't get my contour to look right, whether I use a cream or powder product. The colour comes out extremely uneven, like it's balling up on parts of my skin and simply not going on other parts, and it looks like really exaggerated post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, or dirt on my face. I know not to use a bronzer as contour and to stay away from orangey shades (which make me look even worse, since I'm neutral light olive toned), so it's not the shade. I've used 3CE's contour powder in the cooler shade, and Fenty Beauty's cream contour stick in Amber; the shade match for both of these are fine (not too dark or light), it's just that I can't get the pigmentation to look even. I've tried applying with a brush, fingers, sponge.... nothing helps. The patchiness gets worse as I blend the product out. Powdering my skin before contouring has no effect. I don't usually use primer (since I hate the feeling of too many products on my skin) and I don't think this is a dry skin issue, as I  have moderately oily skin, and I regularly exfoliate and moisturise twice a day. My skin isn't perfect and there is a little bit of texture here and there on the sides of my cheeks, but it's not that pronounced, so I don't think it's my skin's texture interfering with the product either, as people with more textured skin than me can seem to make contouring products work for them. The driest areas of my face are around the eyes and on my chin, and I occasionally get flaking on my chin and nose, but my cheeks generally don't have this problem. Despite that, I have a lot of trouble getting contour and cream blushes to stick. I do have post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from previous spots; contouring products seem to emphasise them, if that makes sense? 

Please help!! I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I can't find anything online that addresses my issue, and similar threads generally conclude that the issue is dry skin, which doesn't seem to be the case for me.

If it helps, the foundation I use is Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Glow Foundation, though sometimes I use Dior's cushion foundation. Also, I still have a problem with patchy contour even if I skip the foundation and only wear SPF over my usual skincare."

I’m super duper oily, though Double Wear puts up a solid fight not sliding off my face at the end of a 10 hour normal day, and I still have quite the red complexion. I’m incorporating vitamin c, gentle cleaners and snail mucin into my skincare routine and I’ve noticed such a difference in my acne, but I’d like to try a lighter weight foundation that perhaps doesn’t enlarge my pores but still gives me an even skin tone and covers minor blemishes. Drugstore foundations simply don’t do it for me (L’Oréal infallible, maybelline stay matte, nope). I just bought Fenty Pro Filt’r soft matte (goes on lighter than Estee and doesn’t accentuate pores as much which is lovely), but I’m already seeing it doesn’t have the stay power like Double Wear.

1650998079,Makeup,"Eyebrow Makeup Question: clean, smudge, shape","Hi ladies! 

I am about to run to Ulta to get some things for my eyebrows but first, I need some help choosing products that fit my needs.

For context, I had a bad eyebrow waxing incident that took off the inner portion of my eyebrows so that they sit further apart than normal. The hair never grew back and I have been working on creating the perfect brow with makeup ever since. 

I add length in the middle using powder &amp; pencil. I’m not a huge fan of gels or waxes but open to ideas there too. 

Here’s where i need your help: 

I do a good bit of smudging when i add length to create a gentle, faded gradient edge. I often wish I had a product to clean up the smudging under and below the brow to make it more defined. I’ve used concealer in the past but it i find it always gets cakey or looks super visible even if I try to blend it out. It almost seems too thick or the wrong color? 

Can anyone recommend a product to use, when cleaning up and shaping around the edges, that gives some umph (or highlight?) but looks a bit more natural and less cakey? Additionally, do those pink pencils work that I’ve seen people use to outline for a bit of a bright effect? 

All suggestions welcome &amp; I’ll let you know what I get :)!"

1651004105,Makeup,Reunited with Laura Mercier translucent setting powder - it is so good,"back in the day I definitely trusted beauty gurus and Sephora too much, now tables have turned and i am always skeptical of them and avoid unless necessary 🤣 when I first started getting into undereye concealing I used the LM translucent because everyone did and didnt question it since thats what all the perfect gurus were using. time went by and i stopped repurchasing the LM powder , started trying new things, saw all these vids of drugstore dupes, people saying other powders are better.. i recently started paying more attention to my eyes and trying to do light brightening/highlighting only to realize that powder always makes them look worse no matter what - it would look great beforehand but powder made it go from hydrated and even to dry if not instantly then shortly after

&amp;#x200B;

i watched a bunch of youtube tutorials like a newbie thinking there must be something im doing wrong and tried a bunch of different techniques (dusting a tiny amount on w a brush, using a damp sponge, powder puff, moisturizing more than usual, ETC) and trying different powders (maybelline fit me, kosas cloud, lys, tarte glow..) nothing was impressive at all. I figured why not go back to my roots and try the LM again with a sober non influencer influenced mind and more experience with makeup and powders. damn guys, the LM translucent really is good.. i have combo skin, this stuff really doesnt make my undereyes look dry yet it controls oil pretty well and just really sits nice on the face. im so confused at how the other powders looked dry under my eyes and sometimes cakey around my nose but this one looks good under eyes but manages oil as well? i dont know if i just have finicky under eyes but it just works on me. if anyone has any suggestions id be super open to hearing them!"

I am tired of my foundation (nars natural radiant longwear) ending up on my deeper toned partner’s face (and it’s happened to multiple so can’t be boiled down to an individual’s specific skin type). I have tried urban decay (original) all nighter setting spray, morphe continuous setting mist, and the too faced 3 in 1. Im inclined to not immediately point the finger at my foundation itself because i dont have an issue with transfer onto clothes or other things (aside from masks but i dont think thats avoidable). 

Anyways it’s embarrassing and i don’t want to have to think about that when I’m smoochin someone.

If it helps my makeup routine after skincare is the tiktok one (LOL):
1. Skincare that ends with fenty moisturizer w/ spf that i let soak in a little bit.
2. Super light light barely there dusting of too faced translucent setting powder
3. Followed by a whole face application of setting spray (not heavy just mist the whole face with morphe continuous setting mist).
4. You wait till that dries/soaks in and then you apply primer, i was using maybelline master primer w/ spf but recently started using the “UD all nighter ultra glow face primer dewy foundation grip” (what a long name). Both are great.
5. Then top with concealer if applicable and/or foundation. 

This has always been an issue (before my tiktok routine, before product changes, etc.), so i think it could be resolved potentially by a better setting/finishing spray or something. But im open to anything. Im genuinely tired of this happening."

On camera my makeup looks too orange or too yellow around the eyebrows but I would spend like 15 minutes trying to blend so it won’t look back on camera. Also speaking of my eyebrows they always tend to look bigger on camera than in person which as someone who has naturally thick eyebrows I always get my eyebrows thin, I wish I could post a photo. My makeup will only look good if I use a filter and it kind of drives me crazy because I would like to take pictures without a filter. 😭 I am dark skin, kind of around the medium brown shade if that helps."

It's always too dark, too pink, too yellow or too bronze.

I as a girl was always into makeup and stuff but wasn't allowed to use it until recently. (I even got a slap from my father for applying lipstick when I was 12-ish. Lol.) I started using eyeliner only a few months back and honestly I am so in love with wearing eyeliner but again I am not allowed to. (Breaking rules a few times a week isn't that bad). Anyway, I got away from the topic. So I used the eyeshadow pallate and brushes (given by my aunt) throughout the last week for my other aunt's wedding. We had a desi wedding if you wonder why it took a whole week. So used the makeup almost everyday for a week trying out different colors and styles(loved the feeling). 
So my question is how often should I clean my brushes? I cleaned them today. I know we should clean them regularly but don't know how often.

I'm also in the market for primer and maybe color corrector? The thing is, I would like to find something organic and wouldn't mind splurging a bit on a nicer product if it's something that I like.  
I haven't been to a Sephora/Ulta/any makeup store in ages so I'm not sure if places even do samples anymore or if that's a no-go in COVID world. So... how do you find samples of products? Is that even possible?

Please don't give me grief if this is a dumb question... my life post-COVID/toddler has just been so sheltered!"

Primer: Skin Aqua Super Moisture Gel (I use my sunscreen)

Foundation: Estee Lauder Double Wear 

Concealer: Too Faced Born This Way Super Coverage Multi-Use Concealer 


I’m trying to lessen my purchases for similar products, so in buying those, I thought that it would be easier to thin out a full coverage base if I need to. I want to use up what I have. 

I don’t wear foundation everyday, I use the concealer most of the time. I’m looking for a product (Primer? Moisturizer?) that I can use to thin out my base and make it look more dewy - the current moisturizer I’m using (Hada Labo Premium Lotion) isn’t doing it."

My earlier shade match was Clinique's Beyond perfecting foundation and concealer in the shade WN 46 Golden Neutral.

And the color is STUNNING I wanted a very slightly warmer glowy pink just like it. However I can’t stand the formula. It makes my lips peel whenever I remove it and it’s one of those glosses where you can feel the glitter pieces. 

Does anyone have recommendations? I know they aren’t traditional glosses, but I’ve heard things about the em cosmetics lip cushion (angele) and the tower 28 glosses (coconut). I adore Dior’s glosses but I think the raspberry and pink shades aren’t similar at all."

When I was starting to branch out with makeup I bought the Luminess Lion King eye shadow palette and face palette from Ulta and fell in love. These two are still faves that a reach for often. This collection is, however, discontinued. (I also learned this brand is a MLM 😬). 
I’m looking for dupes for these two products. I love the shades of the neutrals in the eye palette and also of the face palette. They look very basic in pics, but the way they look on my skin tone and when applied is just amazing. 

Any suggestions for a dupe for these two products?"

1651296733,Makeup,Formula dupe for the old Vice lipstick?,"Urban Decay Vice lipstick was my ideal lipstick formula and I haven't bought a single lipstick since they reformulated to the ""Vice Hydrating Lipstick"" because I don't want to go on an expensive hunt for a suitable new lipstick formula. Does anybody know what lipsticks are similar to the old Vice formula? If you liked Vice, what are your other favorite lipsticks? I liked both cream and comfort matte variations but would primarily be looking for something similar to the cream type. The trend for lipsticks right now, including the Vice reformulation, seems to be juicy sheer lipstick-balms that only have a hint of color - my preference is a creamy, fully opaque bullet lipstick, nothing ""sheer"" or ""buildable"" as it only ""builds"" in the lines on my lips and makes for a really patchy gross lip. In lighter shades, even lipsticks that are supposed to be reasonably pigmented will do this on me, but I never had this problem with Vice lipsticks."

✅  Saturday Palette Review &amp; Pictorial 🤓

......

➡️ NOTE: the information contained within this post is based upon my research, opinions, and experience. As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun.

......

🔺️ PALETTE: Violet Voss - Windflower Palette✌

......

🔺️ ACQUIRED: purchased myself 

......

👁 LOOK CREATED: 'Soft Cut-Crease'

......

▪️ PACKAGING &amp; DESIGN: each pan holds 0.85g of product, square-shaped pans, decorative cardboard packaging, bi-fold, palette name &amp; brand is on cover, light-weight, magnetic closure system, small rectangle shape, mid-size mirror inside, tried a heavy magnet &amp; pans are NOT removable, there is no shade nomenclature 


🔊 NOTICE: 

+ At 0.85g, each shadow weighs significantly BELOW the average amount per pan. I don't think anybody would find difficulty in storing this palette.

......

▪️ COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: China

......

▪️ TOTAL # OF SHADES: 10 (all eyeshadows, which are deemed safe by the FDA for use around the eye area). Upon further evaluation, none of these pigments stained my skin. 

......

▪️ TYPES OF FORMULAS: 2 formulas (5 mattes, 5 metallics)

......

▪️ DESIGNATION: red/pink toned

......

▪️ DEXTERITY CONCERNS: none

......

▪️ DESCRIPTION OF SHADE PRESS: moderate; recommend doing eyes before base with this palette.
 
......

▪️ EXTRA PERTINENT INFORMATION: notated as a 'limited edition' palette, this is deemed part of the 'fun-size' collection - there are three other palettes in this collection, and they are all supposed to complement each other. They are all small, mindful of travel or popping in a bag.

......

✅ ROUTINE DATA CHECK: 

+ clean formula 

+ cruelty-free 

+ vegan 

+ 24-M PAO (not on palette)

......

🔍 COST EVALUATION: (Sephora) 

💲 $18.00 / palette 

💲 $1.80 / shade 

💲 $2.12 / gram 

......

♦️ PRICE PER SHADE SCALE:

&lt;$2=excellent; $3-$4=affordable; $5-$8=meh; $9-$15=expensive; &gt;$16=very expensive 


• Comparing this palette to similar products available on the market, the price-per-shade is 'excellent'. Additionally - this palette has an 'average' cost-per-gram, compared to other palettes I've previously reviewed.

......

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️PATCHINESS: none 


🔸️CREASING: no creasing after 4-hours of wear 


🔸️STAINING: none 


🔸️BLENDABILITY: very easy to blend-out 


🔸️KICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 


+ all shades had kick-back 


+ experienced fall-out, the most being from the deepest matte shade 


🔸️COLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 


+ this palette inholds the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always look for. The included shades range from light to midtone to deep. There is only one option available to create depth in your look, which drastically limit the palette's versatility (i.e., the types/amount of varying looks you can create) 


+ I personally think the decision to incorporate two extremely similar brown shades seems repetitive in such a small color-story 


+ there are a few traditional neutral 'transition shades' included in this particular color-story, possibly sufficient for a wide range of skintones 


+ the formula balance ratio in this palette is 5:5 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 50% / 50% formula split is fairly balanced, &amp; provides enough range-of-use. I prefer either fairly balanced layouts, OR matte-heavy spreads 


+ I classify this as a red/pink toned palette, &amp; I don't find it particularly unique. I own several crossover shades in my collection 


+ there is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal' 


+ throughout exploring this entire palette, I didn't encounter a 'dud' shade 


+ there is no decorative embossing on any of the included shadows

......

🔸️FORMULA EVALUATION: 

//

+ | MATTES |: 

• incredibly soft, smooth, &amp; thin formula

• I didn't have any trouble with the mattes at all

• they work well in creating a gradient

• I found it very easy to layer them 

• each shade applied the same tone/color that they appear as in their pan 

• the matte color selections work well together, it's easy to formulate a look

• this is a more 'buildable' formula (in lieu of being 'directly pigmented'), making it easier to manage and control the formula

//

+ | METALLICS |: 

• each one is very soft, creamy, and thin

• there is no glitter in this formula 

• each one has an intense base pigment, so they are not sheer shades

• very high-shine

• works perfectly well with your finger, a dry brush, or with a dampened brush. I personally think the dampened brush application method looked the best

......

🔸️PACKAGING: 


+ I think the packaging choices of Violet Voss are odd - they seem quite 'clip-art-ish' to me, and don't seem to bear the quality of a high-end palette 


+ I do think this packaging design is a great representation of the brand (Violet Voss), as it's completely inline with similar products offered in the range and collection. As soon as I see one of these palettes, I immediately know what brand it's from

......

🔸️COMMENTARY: this is a nice little palette. I find it incredibly basic, and it inspired me to create a very soft, barely-there look. As for the shadows - the Violet Voss quality is top-notch. I'm always impressed with the formulas, and how well they work. I just wish the packaging equated to the formula, and it would be one of my favorite brands. 

......

▪️FINAL RECOMMENDATION: (recommend)

+ no work to blend 

+ no guessing at creating looks

+ formulas are top-notch 

......

+ Favorite Shade: metallic copper

- Least Favorite Shade: matte orange

......

🚦 RATING: B

......

⭐ RATING LEGEND:

A = totally wow'd me

B = not the best, but I like it

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product

D = this didn't work out for me

F = I totally hate this

So for the past 10 years I've been looking for a good yellow eyeshadow. I've tried a lot! Eventually I had a birthday and 2 people bought me palettes, I now have Alien and Jaw Breaker, the shades are good but I don't like his whole persona.

So while I did dip into those palettes because they where expensive and the people that gave them to me meant well. Now a few years later, I'm still looking for some good pigmented shadows and I just have no idea what to look for. I don't mind spending a bit of money but for something I don't have a recommendation on I tend to be careful. The ones I could try out in stores where disappointing and I notice that also with the Jeffree star palettes , I have to lay it on thick, that's okay but I don't want to keep layering on powders to get a full coverage eyeshadow, I tried a couple in between but nothing get's as good as ''WOW'' but I don't want to buy that palette. I don't even want to buy anything from this guy. 

If any of you know a good yellow shadow, please share! I know not many people ask for this color but I've been told it looks good on me and I love yellow! Any good brand that you know is also welcome but if they have a good yellow you're my hero!"

Rounded bottom. Hourglass shape. The top had a flat side. I loved it more than my beauty blender and I used it until it fell apart.

It was similar to this turquoise one: [https://www.amazon.com/l-f-Blending-Sponge-Latex-Free-85097/dp/B079HTFZR7](https://www.amazon.com/l-f-Blending-Sponge-Latex-Free-85097/dp/B079HTFZR7) in terms of the rounded bottom, hourglass shape, and colour, but this one is missing the flat edge.  
This one has the flat top but is missing the rounded bottom: [https://www.target.com/p/e-l-f-highlighting-blending-sponge/-/A-52504348#lnk=sametab](https://www.target.com/p/e-l-f-highlighting-blending-sponge/-/A-52504348#lnk=sametab) 

I've been through every sponge Target sells online and can't find a match. So far, e.l.f. is the closest match but I'm thinking maybe it was in a shape they no longer make BUT DOES ANYONE KNOW? Anyone remember what beauty sponges target was selling 2+ years ago? That's a normal thing for someone to keep track of, right? Is this the dumbest thing I've ever tried to crowdsource?

My SIL has been living with us for a while after a bad divorce and is really kicking ass and getting her life better than it was. She is very big into doing her make-up and hair.  She keeps mentioning she wants a good area to get ready and just generally decompress. 
I talked to my wife (who doesn't wear make-up, so is as unsure as I am). And I said I wanted to build her a nice area for it in her room. 

So far my plan is:
My space is about 5 feet long

Obviously tons of light. 

Plugs hidden some where accessible

 a wireless charger built into the top.

Something that won't stain easily and
 cleans well 

She mentioned a chair that, to me,  looks like a director's chair, but the only reason is that it has a back, so alternative chairs with backs?

And things like I plan on it being basically 2 small ""cabinets"" with a top that can be removed, so if she ever decides to move, or we all move as a family again,  we can get this huge thing out.   


ANYHOW back to my question. What things would really make an excellent space for you all? Drawers vs cabinets? Big and deep for like blow driers and stuff? Small skinny ones? How many plugs is enough?

I have really long, straight, and light blonde eyelashes that naturally tangle ( maybe because they are soft?) For years I have struggled to find ways to keep them curled all day. I have tried everything. I obviously have an eyelash curler (the tart one). I heat it a little before use, I do the curl up the lash trick. I spend forever curling them bc they take forever to curl in a way that looks nice (they are stubborn!) 

Then I use waterproof mascara (better than sex). I usually end up having to curl them again after applying mascara bc they already start to fall, but then they start to stick to together and look spidery. Then, after all that, a few hours later they will probably start to fall, or be completely straight again! Even in cold weather, so it’s not just because of humidity. 

I guess my question is: what now? Is there anything else I can try? Any tips or products I should look into? I don’t want to rely on extensions or eyelash perm bc of the cost and the maintenance. Thanks everyone!"

The survey assesses how online communities generate interest about cruelty-free products, and whether or not they influence  the purchase behavior of these products. 

I think this is a topic that might interest a lot of people since it researches the relations of media and cruelty-free products. If you are interested, please fill out the survey. The survey should take around 3-7 minutes to complete. Your participation is fully voluntary and a withdrawal from the survey is possible at any point during its completion. No compensation is offered for participation in this survey, but your participation will be invaluable to my research. If you wish to be informed about the final results of the survey please contact me via e-mail after you complete it.

If you have any questions regarding this experiment, please do not hesitate to contact me (my email address is linked in the form).

I’m wondering how “forgiving” these are if the shade isn’t perfectly matched.

Do you all feel like it’s sheer enough to be rather forgiving? Do you like it overall? Feel free to drop other recs for a concealer and/or correctors too. 

TIA!"

Wanted to post a follow up for all you wonderful people who helped me when I asked for foundation recommendations: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/ti9doj/tell\_me\_all\_about\_your\_hg\_foundation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/ti9doj/tell_me_all_about_your_hg_foundation/)

Thanks to everyone who responded - it has been a wild ride that’s for sure. 

I will not buy the lede - the winner is **Giorgio Armani Silk in 5.75**. To quickly recap, I have dry skin and needed a new foundation. However, I have olive skin so it made color matching a bit harder. (I've never worn MAC so idk my color in their system but I am definitely warm and definitely olive)

I kind of treated it like a bracket, and yesterday I swatched the final 2 contenders to declare the winner. Over the course of the week or so, I visited Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Sephora, Target and Ulta.

&amp;#x200B;

I was very up front with every sales person I encountered, and gave more or less this exact spiel - *I am on a recon mission, I will not be buying today but I aim to buy ASAP, I want to sample a foundation at home on top of my sunscreen using my normal morning routine to see how it performs, and I will be purchasing the winner hopefully by the end of the week.* 

Most salespeople were terrible at color matching compared to me trying to find my own match, except 1 woman at Sephora. I don't hold that against them though, cause I see my face multiple times every single day, so it stands to reason I have a better idea of what suits me. Here's everything I tried, in alphabetical order:

&amp;#x200B;

* Armani Power Fabric 6.0 - too deep *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)*
* Armani Silk 6.0 - too deep *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)* It is incredibly annoying that these 2 Armani shades in 6.0 were so different to each other. Power Fabric was deeper and cooler even though they were both 6.0
* Chanel Les Beiges 30 - too pink, no options warm enough *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)*
* Chanel Sublimage 60 - too deep *(matched by a different Nordstrom salesperson, terrible experience, didn't even want to try this foundation and she told me the Chanel one I was after was ""bullshit"")*
* Dior Forever Matte 2WO - *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)* not bad! Decent color match but transfers very easily, so I am not in love with the formula
* ELF Camo CC Cream Light 240W - not bad but I didn’t move forward with it, forgot why
* Estee Lauder DW 2w2 - too deep, iirc
* Estee Lauder Futurist Hydra 1w2  - not bad! Runner up
* Estée Lauder Double Wear 3W1 - too deep *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)*
* Estée Lauder Double Wear 2W1 - better than 3W1 but too pink 
* Estée Lauder Double Wear 2W2 - too deep 
* Fenty Pro Filt’r 145 - ever so slightly too yellow, and 140 was too light. I so desperately wanted Fenty to work, but not enough to buy 2 shades and mix my own
* Fenty Pro Filt’r 290 - good tone, but too deep
* Gucci 250O - too yellow
* IT Cosmetics in Light (I think the Ulta-exclusive one but I am not 100% sure) - side note, it’s infuriating that the shade “Light” is different across all their foundation products, some are cool toned and some are warm toned. And I think they need to name their products a little better, I was confused especially since the packaging is so similar across the board . I appreciate the Estee Lauder shade nomenclature (where 2W1 = depth-tone-level), very easy to navigate.
* Kosas - 160 too light
* Kosas - 210 ever so slightly too deep. This could've been a runner up but I felt the texture was too thick for my liking
* Kosas 270 - too deep (tried this before the 210)
* Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear 280W Bisque - too pink
* Loreal Infallible 420 - too light
* Maybelline Dewy &amp; Smooth 118 - too pink
* Maybelline Super Stay Active Wear 220 - too deep
* MUFE Forever HD 2y20 - too pink
* Nars Radiant Longwear Deauville Light 4 - too light
* Nars Tinted Moisturizer Norwich Light 1.5 - too light
* NYX Can’t Stop Won’t Stop in Nude - not bad! Runner up
* Pat McGrath Labs - No good color match, like at all. So disappointing.
* The Ordinary Coverage Foundation 2.0 YG - not bad! Would’ve moved forward but I read questionable reviews and wasn’t sure the formula was right for me.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Anything that says too light or too deep - this means I couldn’t find the right warm (olive) tone in my depth. For example, the Nars Radiant Longwear was a nice warm color but too light, but if I move one color over to a closer depth, it was the wrong undertone, so then if I move one more to the next it’s now the right tone again but 1-2 shades too deep. Same (but backwards) for anything that says too deep. Similar for anything that says too pink, it means there were no warm options in the right depth.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately Armani 5.75 is the answer.

If I had to pick something other than Armani, these are the ones I would revisit:

* Estee Lauder Futurist Hydra
* IT Cosmetics in Light 
* The Ordinary Coverage Foundation, cautiously

These are the ones I was most disappointed about since the shade was so close but not close enough:

* Fenty Pro Filt’r 145
* Gucci 250O
* Kosas - 210
* Pat McGrath Labs - I think mixing 2 colors would work here but not at $68 a pop.

1648504100,Makeup,Which Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer? Or other recommendations,"I know the reformulation of the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer got a lot of negative reviews. I tried some on in Ulta today, and I thought it was okay but am not sure if the oil-free or natural formulation is better. My skin is fairly dry due to tretinoin, but I also hate the dewy look on me. Some matte foundations I've tried have just made the dryness and lines (over 40 here) look worse. 

I've also seen NARS Pure Radiant Tint recommended instead. I tried it, and it looked fine at first but was super shiny a few hours later. I don't know if a primer might help prevent the shine.

Thoughts on which LM tint would be better? 3N1 is a good color for me as a muted warm olive. Anything else I should look at? My options are limited as my face hates hyaluronic acid, and it's in so many products these days."
1648505780,Makeup,MAC foundation,Anyone use MAC foundation? I just purchased some (although in a slightly new shade as my previous stuff was a little tinted orange for me lol).

As the title says, I’m a little overwhelmed by all the options out there. I’m a 33 year old woman. I’ve never really worn a lot of makeup - I fill my eyebrows everyday, and sometimes curl my eyelashes and wear mascara. If I’m going out, I also wear eye shadow, and a bit of blush. That’s about the extent of it. 

That said, over the last 4 years I’ve had 2 babies and it’s showing on my face. My wrinkles are a little more obvious, my eye circles a little darker and (worst of all!) I have a not-so-subtle « sun mustache ». I’m starting to feel like I would benefit from wearing foundation to even out my skin tone, but I’m concerned because I don’t want to ALSO need to contour and use blush and everything else. I want a foundation that will still allow my freckles to show - kind of like Megan Markle. Would anyone have any suggestions?

Thank you 😊"

Hiyaaa! I've honestly become really interested in eyelash extensions. The idea of having a more natural look with gorgeous lashes to start the day is super appealing &amp; I LOVE how it can look when done in the particular styles I like. However I worry I won't be able to do much more with my makeup if I get extensions. I like wearing different styles of falsies when I go out and enjoy experimenting with different eye/liner looks too. Would lash extensions make that difficult?
Ig I have a few other questions for lash extension people:

- Is it hard to dust off shadow fallout from your extensions?
- Is it hard to clean off your eye makeup with extensions? 
- Is it hard to put in contacts? 
- Did you have to change the way you wash your face?
- How easily do the extensions fall off? 
- Can you swim in lash extensions? 
- Are you able to use mascara with them or can no product touch the extensions at all? 
- If your natural lashes are pretty flat without curling, will the lash extensions also lay flat, can you curl them, or does it change the angle of your lashes when you get extensions? 
- Follow up, if you can't curl your lashes and have straight lashes, can you laminate your lashes + lash extensions? 
- Do they look weird once they start fall off? 
- How long did they last on you? 
- Would you recommend it?"

1648670404,Makeup,Mixing moisturizer with foundation/BB/CC cream?," 

Hi Reddit.

Recently I have been getting more into skincare than I have makeup but I have found a couple different tinted moisturizers that match my skin tone fairly well! I also have been going to the tanning bed (I know the risks) &amp; so my tinted moisturizer has become a bit too light on my face at its palest vs when I'm at my darkest.

I was wondering if there's a way that works for you when you are pale vs when you are darker &amp; if you mix your moisturizer with foundation or just a BB/CC cream.

Any suggestions/tips are more than welcome! (:"

I look really young for my age. I feel that whenever I put makeup on I look like a child who used their mom’s makeup. I definitely lean more towards the natural side of makeup only because if I do anything else, I feel uncomfortable. 

I know how to apply makeup it’s just I don’t have the confidence to wear it out my house. I never have makeup on. Not even a little bit. Not even for occasions. But it definitely would feel nice to wear it once in a while outside.

So my question is, what can I do to help my confidence? And/or what can I do makeup wise that will help flatter my age?

Any advice is greatly appreciated :)"

I tested the foundation once and it looked to be a perfect match, and it looked great when I was putting it on before the photoshoot. I checked my car mirror before we started the shoot and to my horror, it looked darker and pinker than when I initially put it on. It looked like a different color than my neck. I wasn’t able to do anything about it at that point but now I’m just worried how the photos turned out. The thing is, when I took a selfie, it looked like the color matched me perfectly. Will the difference in color show in pictures? Do car mirrors just warp your foundation color in some weird way?? I’m just really stressed about it and wanna hear yalls thoughts

PS yes I realized very soon after that I should’ve tested the foundation longer &amp; practiced before I did it for the shoot; pls don’t make my mistake"

1648775308,Makeup,Spring skincare Tips,"Hi there! I have brought some spring skincare tips to share for today. 

Before I give you some tips, ‘everyone has their own allergies and problems including different conditions’. Please make sure that these are ‘tips’, not ‘prescriptions’.

Did you know that you can get a shining skin from home without spending $$$ to a dermatologist? These are the secret tips from the staff of dermatologys. 

When spring comes, your skin conditions change, so you need to change your daily routine. 

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Exfoliation** \- LHA cleansing

We all already know about AHA, and BHA cleansers. Now it's time for LHA cleansers. LHA has the smallest particle therefore there is less irritation. For those who have sensitive and acne skin can also use it. It will make your skin smooth and shine. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Moisturizing** 

After you finish cleansing, gently wrap your skin with the tower. The moisture inside your skin quickly flies out to the air, so you need to moisture it right away. Use highly moisturizing products such as 'Serumkind - Deep Antarctic Drop', or ' innisfree - Green tea seed serum/cream'.                                                  

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Sunscreen** 

\- During spring the ultraviolet rays are 1.5times stronger than when it is fall. Sunscreen is a must have item for skincare. It is recommended to apply every time you go out and reapply every 2-3 hours. Don't forget to check PA and SPF when you buy the product. In spring SPF50 PA+++ or higher is recommended. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I hope these tips are helpful and hope you all have a wonderful spring skincare routine!"

1648813635,Makeup,How has your makeup routine changed in the past 5-years?,"I’m constantly amazed with my changing preferences in products, styles, and colours. I know a lot of this has to do with fashion trend cycles, but when I was beating my face to the gods in 2017, I thought some of my constant repurchases would be used until the end of time! Bury me with my Too Faced Palettes, I thought. 

Eyes: 
I was a Kat Von D (now KVD Beauty) Tattoo Liner enthusiast. The perfect, harsh winged liner. This winged obsession hasn’t changed much because I still love a winged liner (partial to the Rare Beauty one currently!), however I’ve also find myself reaching for the Charlotte Tilbury Eye Pencil in Pillow Talk for a more natural wing. I never would have considered anything but a black winged liner 5-years ago— pencils seemed like a thing of the past back then! Now we’ve embraced them again. 

Cheek Products; 
I wore more orange toned blushes and was a fan of Nars Orgasm. Now I prefer bright pops of pink, I really like Milk Makeup’s cream blushes as well as Ilia’s ones. My blush placement is also much higher and I bring it up to my forehead like I used to do with my bronzer. Also my highlighter game (cough cough Becca) will never be as bright as it was then. My cheeks will never look as frosty as they did in 2017. 

Lip Products: 
My relationship with mauve lipsticks was a never ending repurchasing cycle. Urban Decay’s Vice Lipstick in Backtalk owned me. I used to walk down the hill from University during breaks between class just to buy a replacement because that lipstick was my identity. Now with the pandemic it is a bit hard, however I do prefer a more sheer lipstick. I’m currently loving the Fenty ones! I’ve also been use the Milk lip and cheek products. These days, I avoid mauve lipsticks like the plague because I think they really washed me out, especially the cooler toned ones…

Tools: 
When did my fingers become the new brushes and sponge???? I really like products from rms beauty where I can really feel and mould the cream products (eg. their concealer that I use religiously). My entire beauty collection was inspired by influencers, which included a multitude of brushes and sponges (tools I do still use, but I’m far less rigid about it when so many of the products I use, benefit from a lighter hand (literally!) 

These are the things I’m constantly thinking about as my makeup routine has evolved and changed. Has anyone else had changes you just couldn’t see yourself having 5-years ago???? It’s currently almost 1am in New Zealand, so yes these are my late night shower thoughts."

I’ve read through a ton of previous posts on here about mixing bases (water vs oil), application (sponge, fingers, brush), and layering (serums, moisturizers, makeup). 

I’m struggling with any and all product looking patchy/spotty throughout the day. I’ve tried 4 different setting powders and countless foundations/tinted moisturizers.

I think I have normal/combo skin but with some redness and fairly large pores. I exfoliate, I use a light moisturizer and give it time to soak in before applying makeup. I’ve tried setting sprays. I feel like I’ve tried every combo/order of application.

I’m looking for a seamless blend, natural finish product. The formulas that have come the closest would be Saie Slip Tint (but it looks greasy without a powder, or eventually looks spotty/separates with a powder), Tower 28 (eventually separates, looks a bit flakey with powder) and the Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Filter - (but it’s a glowy finish - not what I’m after). 

Setting powders I’ve tried: IT cosmetics (pressed), Glossier (loose), Bare Minerals (pressed and loose). ***Are these the problem?? 

I don’t want to look greasy or completely matte. Just natural, no makeup look. 

Please help! If you can share products + what you pair it with, I would be so grateful."
1648840138,Makeup,Fenty beauty hydrating foundation over Milk makeup’s hydro grip primer,"I heard about oil based products clashing with water based products. From what I can see in the ingredients list, the foundation is oil based and the primer is water based. 

I’m thinking of buying the hydro grip primer but I already own the foundation from Fenty. If the primer and foundation are just going to clash, I don’t wanna waste my money with the primer. 

Has anyone used both of these together and can tell me what they think?"

I actually have a great skincare routine but even with it, the concealer will still go dry within a minute or so? I've tried the primer then baking powder trick; cooling your concealer onto your skin first trick; using a brush instead of a sponge; even applying little makeup so that it won't gather up and disappear, but it all comes out the same! 

I really wanna get into makeup more often, but I keep getting discouraged by the stupid foundation or concealer by it continually separating or looking dry as hell. The primers I use are Elf Hydrating Primer and the concealer I use is Elf Hydrating concealer. Please help! I don't have any makeup friends in the community, at this point, I really don't know which techniques I'm doing that is horrible or if it is my products.

I’m getting married in July and since it is a destination wedding (kind of in the middle of nowhere) there are no makeup artists in the area. 

I’ve started trying to get into makeup. I’ve purchased Estée Lauder double wear liquid foundation, Anastasia Beverly Hills loose powder, Better Than Sex (waterproof) mascara, Tarte Shape Tape as well as ELF poreless primer and some nice blush and bronzer. Everything has been going really well! I’ve been applying everyday to get the hang of it… there is just one problem…. EVERY TIME I apply it, I get horrible smile lines and the makeup starts to look not as airbrushed around my mouth as my cheeks. 

Please please does anyone have any tips to fix this? I have started using hardcore moisturiser, and still nothing will help. Any advice is please welcomed ??!"

1648898529,Makeup,Can you help a mom figure out makeup?,"I'm a stay-at-home parent for the last 10 years.  Pre-pandemic, I used drug store makeups.  During the pandemic, I stopped wearing makeup all together.  Most of my peers are low-to-no-makeup wearers.  And I missed that part of girlhood where you learn how-to makeup (grew up rural, went to mid-western colleges). 

So!  I'm asking for advice!  Where should a mom go to get some basic advice on day-to-day make up?  Or to have someone walk me through all these new products.  I'm a gen x person, so I'm imagining a department store make up counter, but that is like two generations ago.  And like I said, most of my peers don't wear much.

My goals are to find a simple face for the few times I need to look more put together.  Church volunteer work. Leading activities with my kid's social groups.  And to find something slightly more dramatic for some of my mom's nights out and date nights.  (Nothing wild, just darker eyeliner and a heavier lip.)

1648909268,Makeup,App for skin tone detection and search for matching products,"A few months ago, my wife shared how difficult it might be to find the right foundation tone: whatever she orders online, she buys a few samples and eventually throws away those that do not work. Especially during COVID-19 lockdown - you cannot try it out in the shop. 

As a software engineer, I decided to challenge myself and try to create an app to help figure out skin tone and match foundation products. I have just released the first version, available on [iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/RTVeujpW) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unotone) \- [http://unotone.com/](http://unotone.com/).  The app flow is quite simple: 

1. Take a photo of your skin, then crop the desired skin fragment.

2. After analyzing your skin tone, the app suggests several tone samples. 

3. Click on a sample from the list that best matches your skin tone. 

3. The app will find a foundation product that perfectly suits your skin color. 

Luckily for me,  my wife doesn't buy so many foundations to test if app detection works very well, so I would be happy to have feedback from you. Let me know if you'll be able to find a perfect match; what you would like to add or change. 

Thank you in advance!"

Based on searches, it looks like at least around half of us stand to put on our makeup. But there's such a limited mirror selection for anyone who stands and it's honestly kind of ridiculous. 
I think a ton of us lean over our sinks, and it's just dumb. 
My back hurts. 

Our Makeup Mirror Options: 

Option 1: 

Sit! There's 7532578 mirror options for those who have a dedicated vanity! 
Oh you don't have the space and/or money for an entirely dedicated makeup vanity? Or maybe that just seems a little excessive for your style? Oh... Uh...? Hm.

Option 2:

Wall mounted vanity mirrors:

1) Basically shows 90% of your face on one side because you're only gonna ever wanna be 90% ready looking at best, amiright?? 
The other side of the mirror:
This option affords you the ability to see the deepest darkest depths of every grueling detail of your face so you can finally see into the epic future of the cells and golden triangle ratios of all the science inside your face. 
Also check out that speck of dust from 2017 still chillin in your nose pore ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

2) Vertically adjustable? Why? You're only one height.
You just have to *perfectly* mount it to your *exact* height Np! Uh... you want to share it with another makeup user...? Have shoes on of varying height? Or maybe you worked out hard that day and you're actually a little bit shorter...?? No. Not allowed. Only perfectly mounted to your one exact height right now, and don't screw it up; it's holes in your wall. 

3) If you want one of either of the previous options, cool! You can pick only one... but then whatever lighting you got going on, good luck! :D 

4) Indecisive? That's okay, there's 4000 options that vary only by 3 degrees, so as long as you know what CoLoR you want, you're good! 


Option 3:

Countertop mirrors:
You... Stand? You sure you don't want to double over? Or look up at your face like you flipped your phone camera? Are you *REALLY* sure...? 


Honestly, how are there so many identical copies of a super mediocre product when there are so many ways of easily improving on this.

......

......

▪️ DESIGNATION: rosey-toned neutral 

......

▪️ DEXTERITY CONCERNS: yes; this palette is quite difficult to open do to its closure-system

......

......

♦️ PRICE PER SHADE SCALE:

&lt;$2=excellent; $3-$4=affordable; $5-$8=meh; $9-$15=expensive; &gt;$16=very expensive 


• Comparing this palette to similar products available on the market, the price-per-shade is 'excellent'. Additionally, this palette has a VERY affordable cost-per-gram compared to other palettes I've previously reviewed.

......

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️PATCHINESS: no patchiness 

🔸️BLENDABILITY: very easy to blend out 

🔸️KICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 

+ experienced kick-back in all shades used 

+ experienced fall-out from the metallic shades (none from the matte shades), the most fall-out being from metallic shade '15' 


🔸️COLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 

+ this palette doesn't really convey the 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always seek. The included shades range from light to midtone. There are no options available to create depth in your look, which drastically limit a palette's versatility (i.e., the types/amount of varying looks you can create). 

+ there are a few neutral 'transition shades' included in this particular color-story. I am unsure how they will fare on a range on skintones. 

+ the formula balance ratio in this palette is 3:12 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 20% / 80% formula split shows that it's leaning heavily 'matte'. I prefer either completely balanced layouts, OR matte-heavy. 

+ I classify this as a rosey-toned neutral palette, &amp; I own similar palettes like this in my collection, but none that boast this many shades at such an affordable cost. 

+ there is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. 

+ throughout exploring this entire palette, I DID encounter a 'dud' shade. The shade '14' is technically part of the metallics, but it is awful. It is not on par with any of the other metallic shades. It lacks movement, as well as any shine in the formula. It's also very difficult to maneuver and work with. 

......

🔸️FORMULA EVALUATION: 

//

+ | MATTES |: 

• each one is velvetlike, and all of them maintain the same consistency across the palette

• they work well in creating gradients 

• layering them is possible, &amp; quite simple 

• they apply lighter-in-tone than they appear in the pan. 

• it required a lot to build them up to reach their maximum potential 

• this is a more 'buildable' formula (in lieu of being 'directly pigmented'), making it easier to manage and control the formula

//

+ | METALLICS |: 

• these shimmers are very brittle, having quite a thick, flakey texture

• all metallics (except the dud) are extremely reflective and high-shine

• each one has a base pigment, making them multifunctional 

• these metallics don't need much building for a perfected, foiled finish

• works perfectly well with a dry brush, works even better with a dampened brush

......

🔸️PACKAGING: 

+ sturdy, plastic-casings are my favorite type of eyeshadow palette packaging. I prefer them, as they stand to protect the fragile shadows within from sustaining any accidental damage. 

+ I think this packaging is a great representation of the brand (Makeup Revolution), as it's inline with several other products in this familial range.

......

🔸️RECOMMENDATION: today, I just wanted to do a very soft, low-maintenance eyeshadow look. Considering there are only 3 mattes in this palette, there's only a very limited amount of ways you can truly approach this color-story. What REALLY impressed me, were the metallics. I was surely not expecting that reflectivity out of a $6 palette. It's quite shocking, really. The 'Reloaded' palette line has SEVERAL (and by that, I mean like 20 or so) other palettes in this line, and I've always been curious about them. I now feel satisfied, as finally having tried one out. It's not the greatest thing in the world, but it's certainly earned every part of its $6 price tag. 

......

▪️FINAL CONCLUSION: (recommend)

+ very easy to work with

+ beautiful, highly-reflective metallics

+ pick-up-and-go palette 

......

+ Favorite Shade: #5

- Least Favorite Shade: #14

......

🚦 RATING: B

......

⭐ RATING LEGEND:

A = totally wow'd me

B = not the best, but I like it

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product

D = this didn't work out for me

F = I totally hate this

1648960833,Makeup,Makeup looking bad all of a sudden :(,"Hey all! First time here, as well as my first time asking for help with this so go easy in me :)

After a good period of time wearing little if any makeup (not leaving the house throughout the pandemic!!) I recently got a new job working in retail, and just generally have been wearing makeup for longer periods of time than I have in a while. I have super oily skin, get the odd breakout here and there but it’s generally pretty clear and even. I used to get those tiny little bumps but investing in a bit of skincare has cleared that up and reduced my oil too. Usually I put my makeup on (I don’t wear a heavy amount, I use a light-medium coverage foundation or BB cream, and the Rare beauty concealer) and I’d say it looks it’s best at about the 1-2 hour mark. After that it starts to look kind of dry and gross from there on out. My theory is that oil is just breaking it down, but that doesn’t really explain why my face looks rough and dehydrated. 

It also seems like my mascara kind of fades away too, I’ve tried different kinds and they all seem to do it :( I’ve tried different moisturisers and powders (or no powder at all), no change. I haven’t tried primer, but I’m trying to avoid layering too much on because I also use the mecca sunscreen (I’ve tried with others/without it, no change) under everything and I find if I layer too many products they bead up and rub off when I apply foundation. I’m not using expired products, or anything wildly different to what I used pre-pandemic, I’m wondering if it’s just my skin being a few years older than it was when I used to wear make up for this long/as often (been a while since I did 6+ hour days in retail, like, a few years before the pandemic). 

I plan to ask at Sephora and Mecca too next time I’m in, but just wondering if anyone here has some pointers or products. I’m not adverse to trying a new foundation, so if anyone has a good one for oily skin (that has reallyyyy light colours, I’m super fair) then let me know. Would be much appreciated x"
1648961524,Makeup,Can eyeliner look good without being on the waterline?,"I've just started using makeup and I've been looking up tips and such for doing eyeliner. Every place I look says to put it on your waterline, but being that close to my eye gives me the creeps. It's as bad as getting an eyelash out of your eye, so creepy."
1648962421,Makeup,Anyone else can’t stand glossy lipstick?,I’m talking YSL Rouge Volupte Shine or similar formulas. It’s basically a tinted lip balm that slips around very easily and I don’t like that.
1648963404,Makeup,Eye makeup makes my eyes water like crazy. Would a lash lift and tint potentially be a solution or would the chemicals make my eyes go crazy for weeks?,"Or any makeup recommendations from anyone who has experienced this type of thing? I've tried lots of brands including ""hypoallergenic"" like Almay, Physician's Formula, Clinique, etc. Anything liquid like mascara and liquid/gel/ink eyeliner is the worst, I can mostly tolerate eye shadow and pencil eyeliner. I'm not sure it's an allergy as my eyes don't itch or anything, they just water so bad people ask me why I'm crying. And the watering never stops the entire day until I take the makeup off. I absolutely love makeup but it's so bad that I only do foundation and brows these days. I would love to wear full makeup again."
1648968477,Makeup,Thoughts on DIOR Forever Skin Concealer?,"So, I  purchased the Kosas concealer yesterday. The problem is, I've seen multiple people saying the shelf life is extremely short.

1648988586,Makeup,"Foundation for very light, pink skin","I've been struggling to find a liquid foundation that suits my skin tone ever since I started doing my makeup. I'm ultra pale and ultra pink, but I quite enjoy it, so I don't want a foundation that will make me look like I've got neutral undertone. My skin is also oily and acne-prone, so foundation must work with that too.

Usually I use matte mineral foundation from Annabelle Minerals (I think it's only available in part of Europe, but maybe some of you know this brand) in beige fairest and it works pretty well in my everyday makeup, but I would like to have something liquid (so it works better with liquid blush and maybe has more coverage) as well.

I've tried Nabla's Close-Up Futuristic Foundation in L15, but it was way too dark for me (even with a fair amount of lightening mixer) and looked yellow/orange on my skin.

Can you recommend any very light and pink foundation that will go well with oily, acne-prone skin?"

1645818789,Makeup,Would you buy nearly 30-year-old eyeshadow?,"A nostalgia group I belong to mentioned Clarion lipstick, and I realized it was a brand name I haven't heard in a very long time. So I decided to Google it, and one of the first few links was a press release that Proctor &amp; Gamble was phasing the unprofitable line out... by 1995.

And then right under it was an Amazon link to Clarion eyeshadow still being sold for $2.99 on the site. Still in original sealed packaging, but at least two of the reviews mentioned that the applicator crumbled as soon as it came out of the package. (Wasn't sure I could link to it, but search ""Clarion Wedgewood"" in Amazon for the listing.) The seller still had seven compacts available.

It didn't come with an expiration date, but Amazon generally only allows a 900 to 1,825-day shelf life for cosmetics shipped from its warehouse. I don't know if that holds true for sellers who directly ship.

I know buying old perfume is fairly commonplace for the nostalgia factor, but do people actively seek out 30-year-old makeup if it was a discontinued brand they enjoyed? (I feel like I'm getting a stye just imagining it. I don't buy makeup from Amazon because I'm already leery of fake products.)"

I love wearing eyeliner but I have not been able to wear any for a few years. About 2 years ago, whenever I would apply eyeliner I would get a reaction, not too sure if it is an allergic reaction or what, but my eyes would water and my nose would become runny for the entire day. Like an annoying amount to where it smeared my eyeliner from the tears and wouldn't end until I thoroughly cleaned my eyes and face, completely removing the eyeliner. Is that an allergic reaction? My eyes would also get a little red and irriated. Anyways, my real question is, is there ANY kind of eyeliner I could use that wouldn't cause that type of reaction? I don't mind paying a pretty penny. I usually use the cheaper brands like Maybelline, or others that were usually around $10-$12. I REALLY want to start wearing eyeliner again! Thank you!"

1645858181,Makeup,Catastrophe!! My favorite foundation was discontinued and I need a replacement!,"It's a sad, sad tale. I have always had a difficult time color matching my foundation. I have been EVERYWHERE. Sephora, Ulta, MAC, ect. I have tried drugstore and designer foundation. Almost every shade either looks too orange, too pink, or too dead and I have hopped from brand to brand trying to find the perfect match. And a year or so ago, I did. 

Tartes Rainforest of the Sea Water foundation in 12N was perfect! It matched my skin perfectly. It had great coverage, great weigh, a gorgeous finish and I was in love with it. A couple months ago I was running low and went back to get more. ITS DISCONTINUED and the worst part is that the shade it was in is DIFFERENT THAN THEIR OTHER FOUNDATIONS. The 12N of the water foundation isn't the same as the 12N if the other ones. I've been using the Sea Hydroflex foundation as a replacement but it's not the same. Now the empty bottle of water foundation sits on my shelf like an effigy to the perfect match I'll never have again. 

Dramatics aside, does anyone have a good dupe? The shade 12N was described as Fair Neutral so I think I might just have really neutral skin and most shades lean cool or warm but idk. I loved that specific color and the fact that it was so light and moisturizing."

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️PATCHINESS: no patchiness 


🔸️BLENDABILITY: very easy to blend out, no harsh lines 


🔸️KICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 


+ some shades had no kick-back, some had just a little bit, and some shades had a lot 


+ experienced some fall-out, the most being from matte shade 'Sting'. 


🔸️COLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 


+ this palette inholds the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always look for. The included shades range from light to midtone to deep. There is only one deep shade (to create depth in your look), which severely limits the types/amount of looks you can create. 


+ there are a broad range of neutral transition shades included in this particular color-story, &amp; they may perhaps work for a variety of skintones. 


+ the formula balance ratio in this palette is 6:6 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 50% / 50% formula split is definitely balanced, &amp; provides enough range-of-use. 


+ I classify this as a yellow-undertoned neutral palette, &amp; I don't own another palette similar to this color-story. 


+ there is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. 


+ throughout exploring this palette, I didn't encounter any 'dud' shades. 


🔸️FORMULA EVALUATION: 

// 

+ | MATTES |: 

• this matte formula performed beyond my expectations 

• it's outstanding for gradients &amp; layering 

• it blended out extremely easily, without creating harsh lines in the process 

• there was no issue trying to build them to achieve maximum potential 

• this is a more 'buildable' formula (in lieu of being 'directly pigmented'), making it easier to manage and control. 

// 

+ | SATIN |: 

• there is only ONE satin shade 

• it is very light-in-tone, and has a slight sheen finish 

• I think due to its finish, it serves as a multifunctional shade - it can be used to highlight, or even blur edges 

• this shade blended out perfectly 

// 

+ | SHIMMERS |: 

• I prefer using this particular formula WET 

• each one bears a uniquely different tone, allowing you to have more versatility in your looks 

• very uniform application 

• when used wet, applies like liquid metal 

• works fine with a dry brush or finger, works BEST with a dampened brush 

...... 

🔸️PACKAGING: 

+ I do believe that the cover design/art is truly reminiscent of the interior color-story, being the golden/yellow undertone of the whole thing. 


+ I think this packaging style is overall a great representation of the brand, and similar to previous palettes in the series. 


+ I personally really like this type of packaging (plastic casing), as it offers the utmost protection of the fragile shadows contained within 

...... 

🔸️RECOMMENDATION: I kinda felt like doing something simple today, but also something reliable. This is one of my go-to looks when testing out a new palette, because it truly allows me to experiment with all of the different formulas. I've been holding off on reviewing this palette for MONTHS, as I wanted to have the 'right inspiration' for it. Well, today was that day - and I just adore every single thing about it! It has amazing reviews (on several websites), and I totally get what the hype is all about! I am sooo glad to have this palette in my collection, and I predict I will call upon this palette frequently, as a means for my every day, routine looks! 

...... 

▪️FINAL CONCLUSION: (recommend) 

+ extraordinary blendability 

+ liquid metal shimmer formula (wet) 

+ great for honeybee-lovers (like me!) 

...... 

+ Favorite Shade: Golden 

- Least Favorite Shade: Queen 

...... 

🚦 RATING: A

⭐ RATING LEGEND: 

A = totally wow'd me

1645979890,Makeup,Tubing Mascara for VERY fine lashes?,"Good morning/day/evening wherever you might be,

To this point Benefit's Roller Lash has been my HG of mascara largely, I believe, due to the wand and the formula.  I have incredibly (baby fine) hair on my head and my eyelashes, while very long and naturally somewhat curled are also incredibly fine and it seems like every mascara I've used tends to droop them quickly.

Also, all mascaras flake off through the day here and there, and this gets into my eyes and under my contact lenses and causes insane amounts of pain and frustration with diminished sight.  (Mascara is the last thing to go on after everything else including setting spray.)  

I saw a post recently about tubing mascara and though this might be an option for me to try but I'm concerned about the applicators.  The silicone-types with tiny bristles seem to do the best for me as far as not clumping my superfine lashes together.  

Can anyone recommend a tubing mascara option that might fit the bill or have similar experience they could share?

The skin on most of my body is a yellowish greenish beige but I have a lot of redness in my face so I wasn’t sure which one to match.

1646003345,Makeup,Foundation wear test— why do influencers use heavy concealer overtop!?,"This just has been bothering while I’ve been looking up some foundation wear tests on oily skin (bite beauty, UD naked skin, L’Oréal serum). YouTubers will take a light coverage skin like foundation and then after they give you a few thoughts about application— they cut to the part where they apply a medium/full coverage concealer on the sides of their eye, under, along the bridge of the nose! Basically everywhere.

This ruins the wear test. I feel like a wear test should just be product no primer, just the foundation. And maybe day 2 with primer and setting powder. I think stephs beauty stash does it this way— but she also mixes product. Esp when YTers are trying two new products with first impressions—a foundation and then try a new concealer overtop! To try and make multiple videos for the same face. 

Just some thoughts."

I do brow stuff and bronzer sometimes as well, and that’s about where it ends for me.

1646158469,Makeup,Home Remedies For Beautiful Skin - Retain the desired look,"The skin care products have flooded the consumer market these days. These products claim to improve every aspect of the skin needs. In addition, many products claim to be multifunctional while many other products are meant for single need, for instance fairness. But, unfortunately these products are only useful when they are used continually; whereas the home remedies for beautiful skin helps to repair the skin, and fulfill the needs of the skin naturally. Moreover, the skin care products in the market are unable to solve skin problems unless you use them regularly. But, once you discontinue these so called miraculous skin products, your skin turns as it was before. The home remedies for beautiful skin not only helps to retain the desired look but, also it helps the skin to be beautiful even when these remedies are discontinued.

The skin cannot turn to be beautiful unless it is treated with different ingredients which may help to increase the needed nutritional needs of the healthy skin. Moreover, the skin is the only part of the body which receives the maximum exposure. That is why, it is important to protect and pamper the skin in order to keep it healthy and beautiful. The home remedies for beautiful skin help the skin to retain its natural health and thus, keeps it beautiful. The skin care products can burn a hole in the pocket of the consumers without guaranteeing the desired result. But, the home remedies for beautiful skin is inexpensive, and the ingredients for these remedies are available right into the kitchen of every home. Some of the effective home remedies for beautiful skin are mentioned ahead.

1. Exfoliating the skin is very necessary because it removes the dead skin cells, toxins and other harmful deposits that may be responsible for your skin problems. Take one-fourth cup of table salt in a bowl. Add olive oil in the bowl until it covers the salt. Stir the solution, and gently rub this scrub all over your body. Later rinse thoroughly.

2. Moisturizing is also very necessary, to keep skin soft and smooth. Mix one-third cup of oatmeal in half cup of hot water. Stir the mixture, and allow it to thicken. Prepare another mixture by thoroughly mixing 2 tablespoons of honey, 2 tablespoons of plain yoghurt and 1 egg white. Now, combine both mixtures and blend properly. Apply this mixture on face for 15 minutes. Rinse the face with warm water.

3. Cleansing the skin is also an important part of home remedies for beautiful skin. Mix equal amounts of honey and plain yoghurt. Apply this mixture on face for 15 minutes. Rinse with warm water.

4. A Body buffer is a fantastic way to moisturize the skin, but it is expensive in salons. Prepare one at home by mixing 4 ounces of each jojoba oil and shea butter with 3 teaspoons of any essential oil, and 1 ounce of beeswax.

5. Lips are most sensitive parts of the body. Combine 4 ounces of each shea butter, and sweet almond oil with 1 tablespoon of beeswax, and melt them together. When the mixture cools down, apply it on lips for 15 minutes.

1646158652,Makeup,Eyebrow gel causing eyebrow hair loss?,"Hello
I’ve recently started using cover girl easy breezy brow these last two weeks and I thought it was amazing because it would give me a natural fluffy eyebrow look with only a few swipes. Plus my brow hair wouldn’t budge for the whole day but I’ve noticed that when I remove the makeup at night that there were quite a few eyebrow hairs on the makeup wipe or cotton pad. I’ve never seen this much of my eyebrow hair on the pad when I’ve finished removing the makeup before and it’s never this much when I use a regular brow pencil or pen. I’m worried that if I continue using this that my eyebrows will become sparse. Are there any good gels out there that won’t harden the brow to where a lot of hairs fall off at removal? When I remove I use a makeup remover wipe or a micellar cleansing water on a cotton pad and leave it on my brow for a little before I wipe and even then I’ve seen a lot of eyebrow hairs coming out 😓 any help, tips or makeup recommendations would be appreciated."

I saw reviews saying all you need is one pump, so I tried that this morning and it was difficult getting it to cover everywhere. It looks ok, basically no coverage. I’ve tried it with a beauty blender, flat foundation brush and a buffing foundation brush, and tried three different primers. It just seems very meh to me.

1646267474,Makeup,In Search of the best Eyebrow Product,"Hi, everyone!
Recently, I've been trying to look for a new eyebrow product that's cruelty-free since I finished up my L'Oreal Paris Brow Stylist Sculptor Pencil. It was honestly one of the best products I've ever used for my eyebrows since it was super pigmented, very easy to apply, lasted all day on my face, and lasted a long time in general. I have an issue with finding good eyebrow products since my eyebrows are quite light and my hair is a very dark brown. So, I decided to just buy a bunch of different products, try them out for a bit, and see if I like them. Here's what I've tried so far:

1. Elf Cosmetics Instant Lift Brow Pencil (https://www.ulta.com/p/instant-lift-brow-pencil-xlsImpprod14521105)
This eyebrow pencil is pretty good. I got it in Deep Brown about 3 weeks ago. I used it everyday and I'm just about to be done with it so that's not a crazy long lifespan. It was a very affordable option, though, and the pigment liner was decently sized. I will say that the color is not the best since it shows up as a grey-brown on my brows, especially when I've put concealer on. I would say 6.5/10

2. Elf Cosmetics Wow Brow Gel (https://www.ulta.com/p/wow-brow-gel-pimprod2003078)
I got this around the same time as the brow pencil. I don't use it very much though. I think this product is very good if you have very thick eyebrows and want something to kind of hold them in place and give them a little bit of pigment. For me, though, it doesn't really do anything. It's nice though and stays on all day. I would say 6/10, but I'm not really the audience for this product.

3. L.A. Colors On Point Brow Pencil ( https://www.lacolors.com/products/on-point-brow-pencil?variant=19849326166070)
I got this around 1.5ish years ago in Dark Brown, and I'm just about done with it. It was pretty affordable at $2.00. It was waxier than other pencils I've tried though and also had like a grey tone on my face. I would say 5/10.

4. Wet'N'Wild Ultimate Brow Micro Brow Pencil (https://www.wetnwildbeauty.com/ultimate-browtm-micro-brow-pencil.html)
I got this one a couple years ago in Deep Brown, and I'm not really a fan. It's super tiny and the lead breaks really easily. Also not a whole ton of product. I honestly forgot about it until I was cleaning out my makeup bag. The color is nice though. 4.5/10.

But those are the ones I've tried. If you guys have any suggestions for good eyebrow products, please let me know!"

I bought a dress, I may wear heels, just stuff like that. However the biggest issue is my want to do eyeliner. I haven’t done makeup since I was 5-7. So I just got some questions on what I should be doing.

1. Am I supposed to put on foundation before the eyeliner? Or can I just bareface it? 
2. What’s a good way to get started? I plan to use white eyeliner to contrast with my dress but I’m worried it’ll not do right.
3. Would it be best to just do black liner?

1646301782,Makeup,Primer Advice - My favourite primer is discontinued,"My favourite primer - the Urban Decay Optical Illusion primer is discontinued. I'm almost out and I need to find a new primer. What I liked about this primer: It filled out my pores; evened out my skin tone a bit; played really well with my make-up and caused no creases and helped with longevity; a little went a long way so I didn't need to buy a new primer every few weeks or months and was thus perfect to use all over my face. I liked that on no-make-up days I could put on the primer and get nicer looking skin.   


I don't mind spending a bit more on a new primer, as long as it's good and will last me a while. I would like a primer that fills up the pores and creases in my skin and makes my makeup a bit more long-lasting. I'd also like it to work well with my oily skin. It doesn't necessarily need to be mattifying, but super hydrating formulas generally don't work very well for me.

1646311777,Makeup,The most non-waterproof/ easily removable makeup products?,"Hello!

To keep a long story short, I have always had quite nice skin, that was until I got into skincare, specifically cleansers. Turns out that my skin cannot handle cleansers, most surfactants and even emulsifiers not only make me break out, but literally give me contact dermatitis. I have tried at least 20 cleansers, same reaction every time, even with micellar water or oil cleansers. This has left me with a broken moisture barrier and extremely dehydrated skin. Multiple dermatologists have advised me to wash my face with water only, which makes it hard to wear makeup of course. I would have even gone with makeup wipes, but in my few past experiences with them they have always stung or burnt my skin.

I have finally found a cream/milk cleanser without surfactants that my skin tolerates. However, it’s cleansing power is not that great.

I would love to start wearing a little bit of makeup, but I’m afraid of not removing it properly. I have tested the Shiseido future solution lx foundation (which I know has mineral spf filters which makes it especially hard to remove) on the back of my hand and tried to double cleanse with my milk cleanser. It got rid of a surprisingly big amount, however after I double checked with the Clinique TTDO cleansing oil and a cotton pad, there was still more residue left than I would be comfortable with.

Which leads me to my question: what are some of the most non-waterproof/ easily removable makeup products that you know? I usually don’t sweat or do any activities that would compromise the makeup, so that is not an issue. I’m a complete makeup newby and specifically looking for products such as blush, bronzer or highlighter. Are powder or cream products generally better for my problem? Any specific recommendations? 

Any help or recommendations would be beyond appreciated, thank you for your help :)"

Anyways… it’s been over half my life now (early 30s) and I’m tired. My eyes are becoming sensitive so most foundations and I’m tired of feeling my eyes burn every day and feeling self conscious to leave the house without it.

I only found one concealer recently that seemed high quality (lava art) and didn’t make my eyes burn, but it’s so expensive! $40 a month!

Anyways… I’m too nervous for eye fillers quite yet. But I know this is hereditary and bone structure. I’ve experimented for years. 

I feel so insecure without my foundation, but I just wish I could go outside my house with natural makeup on and no foundation and feel pretty. 

Some say to just rock it and accept it… I never have been able to. It’s hard to when people make comments, which is so inappropriate in my opinion. Is it horrible to also want to look pretty, young and vibrant like the non dark circle people?"

1646346314,Makeup,Foundation recommendations for dry/acne prone skin?,"This is my very first post on Reddit, and on mobile at that so sorry for any formatting issues!

I (24F) have pretty dry skin. I just moved to South Dakota from Florida and my skin is going absolutely batshit. I have a pretty hydrating skincare routine that I do now and I’m happy with it. The problem is when I put on foundation and go outside it literally looks like it’s flaking off my face. I don’t know if it’s the icy wind assaulting me that causes it or the foundation itself, but even on non windy days it still looks like shit. 

I usually have some form of active acne on my face and some red/brown scarring on my cheeks and chin that I’d like to cover. I’ve been using IT Cosmetics CC+ cream for as long as I can remember mostly because it was gifted to me by my mom and it was just easy to keep buying it over and over again. 

I used to use it on top of supergoop mattescreen. Some days it’d look just alright and other days it would separate so bad it’d look like I applied my foundation with a bushel of twigs. I just recently read it works best without primer so I started doing that. It still clings onto all my dry patches so bad that sometimes when I look in the mirror after work I jumpscare myself. 

I’m in the market for a new foundation that has enough coverage to hide my active acne/dark spots but also look natural on top of my weirdly crusty yet pimpley skin. 

Also just learned wearing a primer with the same ingredients as your foundation helps? So if all my fellow crusty peeps could drop the primer they use (if any) with their fav foundation that would be a huge help! Thanks friends!"

1646376032,Makeup,PSA - Avoid Ardell eyelash extensions,"I love the look of individual lashes. I hate how long it takes to apply them just to take them off that same day. So when I saw this Ardell individual lash extension kit I thought it’d be a good idea. I was so so so wrong. 

The first 5 days they were great. They looked nice and I enjoyed waking up and having pretty lashes. After that, they started to kinda bug me and some of the extension clusters looked a little wonky. I wanted them off but I waited 3 more days.

The kit comes with glue remover.  I soaked my lashes with it carefully, holding a soaked cotton bud to the glue for about 3-5 minutes and gently trying to swipe them off. I got absolutely nowhere with that method and started to slightly panic. My eyes and eyelid were irritated at that point. I shelved it for the night and decided to try a new approach the next day.

I tried steaming my face for 15 mins to ‘loosen up’ the glue. Back to the same glue remover method. Nothing. I tried using oil, makeup remover, a different glue remover, hot compresses, more steam, a shower, bargaining with god, prayer and manifestation. NOTHING.

I gave up again. 

I continued these acts of desperation for another week. Sometimes it worked and I would get a few clusters off, but my own lashes were coming with them. It looked awful having these gaps between the extensions so to lessen that I cut them close to my lash length. Very stupid very risky. Luckily I think that turned out ok for the most part.

It’s now been over two weeks. The final extension JUST came off, pulling six of my natural lashes off with it. Seems excessive, how did I even manage to glue those all together?

My eyelids are irritated, I have a couple bald spots on my lash line now and overall I hated everything about this experience. 0/10 do not recommend. Sticking with strip lashes or mascara from now on."

All i'm interested in is putting just like cover the 2 scars. I have no interest in covering my entire nose. Last year, i was watching some girl talk about makeup on youtube(what has my life come to,lol) and she mentioned NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP HD Studio Photogenic Concealer Wand, Medium Coverage - Green. I was like ""oh, that's cool it's like white out,lol.. I'll just lightly paint the 2 areas and be done with it. I buy it, put it on my nose and i'm like ""wtf? My nose is green,lol"" Okay, so this is where I'm at. I'm okay with the scars showing, but not as much as they do now. So, like i'll barely brush the top of it is what i'm looking to do. I'm white and pale, so it's stands out.... Okay, somebody can offer some help. Thanks in advance.."

1643296566,Makeup,Ready to start wearing makeup (I think),"Hi everyone!

I recently cut my hair off and have a pixie cut. I love it, but I've realized that my face could benefit from a little makeup to look more feminine. I'm married to a woman, but not butch and so I want to look feminine still while I have my short hair. 

The only thing is, I've really never worn makeup. My wife has never worn it, and neither did my mom or sister. So no one ever taught me what to do. I went through a phase in middle school/early high school where I was trying, but naturally I wasn't very good at it and teenage girls can be mean. So I threw everything out and didn't really touch it again. 

I don't even know where to start. I really want to make an everyday routine that I can use, but I'm not sure that I'm ready to invest in a lot of expensive products all at once (I know they're high quality, but I just don't know what I like yet!). I definitely also need something that's either really foolproof to use or else easy to correct mistakes. 

I've got super pale skin that is clear the majority of the time, and really thick/dark eyebrows that (probably) don't really need much done with them. 

So, for all my ladies out there willing to take a very confused/overwhelmed person and help her out, please give me your best starter kit recommendations."

I don't have any foundations and stuff to mix things with - I like BB creams for the simplicity.

## [“Milk Tea Alliance” releases investigation report on COVID-19 transmission](https://teamilk951.tumblr.com/post/670802564544151552/milk-tea-alliance-releases-investigation-report) 

Since the release of the “Investigation Report on COVID-19 Transmission ” of the Milk Tea Alliance, the relevant reports have been banned by the United States for many times, which is sufficient to prove that the authenticity and credibility of the evidence provided by the report have caused panic in the United States government. Since the prevalence of COVID-19 in worldwide, the U. S. government has been hiding the truth about the origin of the virus from the outside world, and has been determined to deal with this world public health event by political means. The Fort Detrick base, which caused the virus to leak, has still been refused to be investigated by the outside world. Although the U.S. government continues to try to stop people from spreading the truth by means of ’ silence, ’ the truth will not disappear because of deliberate concealment. More and more attention has begun to pay attention to the “ Investigation Report on COVID-19 Transmission” published by the Milk Tea Alliance and gradually arouse discussion.

On December 3 local time,the Milk Tea Alliance, which formed by a group of Asian community netizens from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Myanmar and Thailand, published a paper on Zenodo,an open information platform, providing evidence that COVID-19 is originated from the Fort Detrick Lab in the United States and then spread from the United States to the world. 

The core content of the paper is roughly divided into four points. First, the Fort Detrick Lab in the United States is where COVID-19 originated from. Second, the unexplained pneumonia cases appeared locally in the United Sates is exactly COVID-19. Third, it explains how the United States spread COVID-19 to the world. Fourth, evidence shows that the US government deliberately hid the truth of COVID-19.

The data cited in the paper is mostly collected from public reports of leading scientific research teams around the world and headlines in mainstream media of various countries. Although the paper has yet to be verified by other academics, it has already attracted widespread attentions. By far, there is no immediate response from the United States. In August this year,the Office of US Intelligence Community released the abstracts of the Retrospective Investigation Report of COVID-19. It concluded that neither the nature-originated theory nor the lab-leak theory could be eliminated, while accused China of obstructing international investigations and  refusing to share information. China firmly opposes and strongly condemns these accusations."

👉 NYX Cosmetics - The Marshmallow Primer 


First-Impression Review: This is a really hot commodity that I've had my eye on for awhile! Before I actually applied it, I tried to learn it. When I pumped it out, the actual product is a very thick, structured, white cream. As I rubbed it onto the back of my hand, I observed it to have a very soft, sweet scent. Also, (it's worth noting) that the pump dispenser mechanism dispensed the appropriate amount of product in one pump, &amp; it didn't require much effort to pump. I decided to apply this primer as an all-over base primer, to see how it's best used. After it dried, I studied my face, &amp; found a significant improvement in my most-porous areas. This primer also provided me with a considerable amount of hydration that didn't feel overwhelming on the skin.

👉 J.Cat Beauty - Master Class Face/FX Color Palette 


First-Impression Review: These palettes have been making their way around the internet, so of course - I HAD to try them! My initial reaction to touching the palette was one of slight shock. The creams felt VERY stiff to-the-touch. I also found them to have a noticeable 'waxy' scent. The reason why I wanted these palettes (specifically) was for underpainting - the act of highlighting &amp; contouring your facial structure prior to foundation application. Upon use, I found that these palettes are just pure FUN. I probably wouldn't use these for an 'every day' look, but more when I'm feeling a particular spark of creativity, &amp; wanting to deeply engage with my products. After application, the creams happened to have a pretty decent coverage-level on their own. But, I REALLY like them for my original, intended purpose - underpainting. Each shade combination blended beautifully on my skin, &amp; I had no problem mixing together a custom-blend. Everything picked-up and blended super well with a brush.

👉 L'Oréal - Hydra Perfecte Perfecting Loose Powder 


First-Impression Review: I never, ever heard anybody comment on this powder before - so I was intrigued! By simply exploring the powder prior to use, I discovered that a LOT of powder passes through the myriad of small holes in the plastic separator - making this a potentially very messy product. It does fully come with a separate applicator-poof, if that's your preferred method of powdering. As for the scent, this powder has a VERY strong, soap-like aroma to it! As I swatched it, upon close examination - there is definitely micro-shimmers in this formula (which I personally am not immediately opposed to). Upon actual use, it completely toned-down ALL of my excess shine. In result, it gave me a gentle, glowing base. I prefer this type of product for more as a 'finishing powder'. There is absolutely no denying just how much I love this powder's stunning finish. It didn't look 'cakey' anywhere, or look excessively powdery on my skin.

👉 E.L.F. Cosmetics - Brow Lift 


First-Impression Review: I've heard very polarizing reviews on this product. I think in order to love this, you've gotta love the 'feathered/laminated' brow look. If that look's not for you, this product isn't something you'd like. Upon touch, the texture of this brow gel is actually quite solid, but it does 'give' with applied pressure. It has quite a strong 'hair gel' type of scent. While I used this product today, I didn't use a coordinating brow-filling product, as I just wanted to test the bounds of the gel on its own. Upon using this product, I identified this as a VERY strong brow gel - it effectively changed the direction of my brow hairs. I decided to apply it with a 'bent' spoolie, &amp; then used the back-end to achieve the 'laminated' effect. This particular brow gel took longer-than-normal to fully dry-down. It does dry-down with a 'stiff' feeling, but not at all crispy.

👉 Essence - Volume Booster Lash Primer 


First-Impression Review: Using a lash primer is such a vital part of owning the 'ultimate lash look'. Sure, it takes a little extra time, but well worth it if you happen by a quality-primer. THIS lash primer features a natural bristle wand, &amp; applies in an opaque, white color for easy detection. There is a noticeable scent to this product, as well. I decided it was the best idea to use this lash primer in conjunction with the same brand's mascara. Applying the primer itself, I felt that it really separated &amp; lifted my natural lashes prior to any mascara. When I finally applied my mascara, I felt that the mascara just simply applied MUCH better - I achieved a more full, lengthy look overall.

👉 Juvia's Place - Luxe Liner 


First-Impression Review: I know there's a lot of drama surrounding Juvia's Place, but I bought this lip liner quite some time ago, &amp; just felt like trying it today. I'm in no way insinuating anything regarding this brand, nor the drama. The lip liner itself is an automatic-pencil type, so you don't have to sharpen this one. It features a desirable, pointed tip, as well as a color-preview-strip on the back-end of the pencil. I really like color distinction on the actual packaging, as it makes each color easily identifiable (especially if you own multiple shades). I encountered this liner pencil to be very easy to apply &amp; completely fill-in my lips. I didn't experience any mishaps - regarding skipping or dragging of the product. Currently, my lips are very dry (&amp; in pretty bad shape due to my neglect) but that didn't stop this liner from performing! I was able to get a fully saturated color with this liner pencil.

Sometimes when using foundation, which I do rarely, it immediately disagrees with my nose and every pore seemingly gets clogged and I get that “strawberry” nose where oil pushes to the surface and it becomes super textured. This is after cleansing, HA serum, and moisturizer (using Ordinary and Biossance products). I exfoliate every couple of days with chemical exfoliators (YTTP). When this happens, I always wash it off immediately and exfoliate again and go without foundation … which I don’t know is the right thing to do, but it looks SO noticeable I try to address it right away. 

Is it the foundation? In this case Tarte hydro flex water serum or something else? Or is my face not as moisturized as I think? 

Thanks so much I’m advance!"

I feel like I should have some basic products and a simple routine down. I will also graciously accept suggestions for YouTubers or technical resources for my expertise conundrums.

Products: 
-Eyeliner
-Mascara 
-Eyebrows
-Blush(?)
-Lip item
Do I need to do all the priming and setting? I've been recommended lash primer; should I indulge? 

Ultimate beef:
My eyebrows are going to make me cry. So many product choices and so much potential for satan's fuckery to mess up my entire face for months. Should I get them threaded or... One of the other billion eyebrow services? 

Info about me 🥰:
I have fair skin, like extremely, “i can see all of the veins in my hands”, pale. And a round face but sharp cheekbones and straight nose. Like kinda masculine in many ways. 

Cost:
Also, I'm looking for drugstore stuff(Canadian btw), but I can spare a penny or two for products that are deemed worth it!"
1643428410,Makeup,Best Drugstore Foundation and Concealer?,"Any recommendations? 

I don't have much preference for foundation other than it must be non-matte/non-drying and sheer to medium coverage. 

As for concealer, definitely need a concealer that can cover up dark circles and won't settle into any fine lines. All recommendations are welcome but I am looking for cruelty free products only."
1643428886,Makeup,Best powder contour and setting shade for fair skin?,"I normally use the ABH contour pallet, but I ONLY use the lightest contour shade and then the fair / yellow shades to clean up my contour and set under eyes.

1643481882,Makeup,My complicated relationship with makeup (advice greatly appreciated!),"Hey beautiful people, 

First things first: I'm 26f, queer. When growing up I had a phase where I disliked makeup, back then it felt like all women *had* to wear makeup and I felt pressured. I didn't like wearing it, so I stopped. But my relationship to makeup since then has changed, I think of makeup as a way of expressing oneself and to pay respect to your body. I swoon whenever I see cute people with perfect winged eyeliner or an amazing sparkly highlighter. I'd like to stat anew, to begin wearing makeup again every now and then. But there's been such a long disconnect from my teenage years that I feel left behind. Whenever I try to put on makeup now, I feel like a child who's trying too hard. Also I feel fake in a way, which is really weird. Like a potato trying to be a smooth, shiny apple. It's not about applying too much, I've found a lightweight foundation that I really like and just a touch of finishing powder. There's some aspects to my face that don't really help as well, I've got the thinnest lips in the universe and a large-pored nose which starts to sweat easily. 

But I'd like to put effort into my looks again. I want to appreciate my body and accentuate what I like, but I feel so ugly when doing so. It's a weird mental blockage, I know. I've built a solid skin care routine during lockdowns which greatly helped, which makes me appreciate my skin more. I'm a social butterfly, extroverted and love to wear colourful clothing, so makeup would really really suite my style. But I can't get the hang of it. I feel dumb whenever I try. And I don't know what to do. 

I feel like I'd need a makeup queen (queen as a gender neutral term here) to compliment my efforts, to cheer me on. I can't really ask my friends to be like that for me, they've got their routines figured out and I'm too anxious to ask them, I feel silly. 

Any advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated. 

TL; Dr: stopped wearing makeup a long time ago, want to start anew but feel fake and dumb when doing so nowadays. Mental blockage."

I need a new bronzer or something to do a little natural contour with. I don't usually use stuff with a lot of shimmer in it, but I'm up to try.

An eyeshadow palette that's for everyday use. But also with some nice blue and purple colors would be fun. Any recommendations?

1643497484,Makeup,why doesn’t my makeup look like people on tiktok?,[removed]
1643498488,Makeup,"Does my face just not work with lipstick, eyeliner, and mascara? (~40yo, Kibbe Soft Classic with Soft Autumn Coloring)","I've discovered that the best makeup for me is basically: 

1. Really good skincare so I'm not broken out
2. A hint of cream blush (RMS Modest or Smile or Ilia All of Me)
3. Naturally waxed brows with a swipe of gel
4. A little bit of highlighter (RMS Living Luminizer mixed with Master Mixer), subtly at cheekbones, undereyebrows, and inner eye corners
5. On special occasions, LIGHT serum foundation (1 part Ilia Salina mixed with 2 parts Ilia Bowen) and a tiny bit of concealer (RMS 11.5) around t-zone/inner eyes/under eyes
6. Sometimes mascara works on me, sometimes it just brings out my forehead wrinkles. Switching to brown-black and taking most of it off seems to help. 
7. If I'm feeling dramatic, I can get away with exactly ONE lipstick: Spice by L'oreal—it's a deep rich brown with a hint of red and it is literally stunning on me. The same can be said for absolutely no other lipcolor I've found. 

Less seems to be more. I find most lipstick/eyeliner/eyeshadow just looks...wrong on me. It ages me. But it also makes me look like I'm 8 and trying to wear makeup. Or I can sorta-kinda pull it off but it's wearing me a bit, if you know what I mean. Like my face doesn't have the ""strength"" to carry it. It definitely screams ""I'm wearing makeup!"" and not in a good way. 

My mom was a talented makeup artist who looked great in a full face, so it's not because I'm doing it wrong...I don't think? 

I thought maybe it was wrong colors, so I extensively swatched AND photoshopped on myself and brought home a haul. Nope. It's the effect. The dark brown eyeliner for a subtle cateye matches my coloring, and I'm applying it correctly...it's just ""too much."" The first thing you see. (Wondering if I could get away with a subtler, light brown cateye? Is that a thing?) The deep red looks good with my coloring, it's just loud and jarring. Even the peach tones look old-ladyish and try-hard. 

I think it may be because I'm a soft autumn with my grey hair now (salt and pepper at 40), fair-medium skin, and dark anything or contrast anything is too much (except the lipstick is somehow okay?) 

I tried lipsticks ranging from a good brick red, to a fun plum, to a wine-shade, to a lighter glowy nude, nothing trendy, all classic. They all looked...wrong on me. Even when the color was ""right"" for a soft autumn, I still just looked better without them! They made my thin upper lip look a little thinner and aged my face. Or the subtler ones went muddy nineties warm brown on me, and it wasn't flattering. 

The only one that kinda worked was a very sheer brown, but it had a bunch of sparkles in it—whoops. But I wonder if this is the way to go...more of a sheer brown (sans sparkles)? There was one time I owned a brown lip stain that I LOVED but of course it's discontinued now. 

While I'm mostly happy with my above routine, I would like to find a way to look a little more ""done"", or just have some fun on special occasions, esp on the lips front. What should I do? What works for my fellow soft classics, or anyone who just can't pull off regular lipstick?  

The lipstick shades I tried were all L'oreal, mostly Colour Riche. Raisin Rapture, Glowing Nude, Divine Wine, Rouge St. Germaine, Spiced Cider, Ginger Spice, Ambitious Red, Classic Wine (so bad)."

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️Patchiness: no patchiness 


🔸️Blendability: easy to blend out 


🔸️Fallout: experienced some fall-out, the most being from shimmer shade 'Sea Glass'. 


🔸️Shade Variance: this palette doesn't have the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I look for. Each shade included is a midtone or lighter, it is lacking any true depth capacity. There are a few traditional neutral transition shades included in this particular color-story, &amp; they may work for a variety of skintones. The formula balance ratio in this palette is 4:6 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 40% / 60% formula split is fairly balanced, &amp; provides enough range-of-use. There is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. There were no 'dud' shades in this palette. 


🔸️Formula: 


MATTES: I liked the actual formula of these mattes well enough, but there wasn't really any true depth difference between them. It was difficult to use this palette in the way that I like to wear eyeshadow due to its limited color range. Each matte blended out nicely &amp; built well upon itself. I find this to be a more 'buildable' formula as opposed to extremely pigmented straight away. 


SHIMMERS: I enjoyed using these shades. I really liked that even if you over-blended them, they were resistant to lose their intensity. Some of the shimmers are incredibly smooth &amp; one-noted, &amp; others had quite a bit of microglitters that created a gigantic mess (although they DID look pretty on the eye). 


FOILED METALLICS: of course, this would be my FAVORITE formula within this whole palette. Sadly, there are only two of these shades - but they are sure fun to play with. Both shades are somewhat flaky upon touch, but present as extremely shiny shades that can be used in a multitude of ways. They even picked up perfectly on a dry brush. 

......

🔸️Packaging: the packaging isn't necessarily reminiscent of the interior color-story, but it is a good overall representation of the brand &amp; who they are as a company. I think it works.

......

🔸️Recommendation: Again - I had to wipe off my original looks several times. THIS is not my type of palette, it wasn't created for someone like me. I attempted to do one of my most-favorite looks with it - &amp; I could NOT get it to perform for my style of makeup. I sat back &amp; pondered. THIS palette was created for the person-on-the-go; somebody who wants to achieve a quick look with minimal effort. A shiny shade on the lid &amp; something matte in the crease. If that is your style, you will really enjoy this. I'll tell you that you cannot get a gradient with this, &amp; the included shades aren't the best for layering. It's made for a totally different consumer than me, &amp; I can recognize &amp; appreciate that. If you like simplicity, this gives you plenty of options. 


The price per shade is 'meh'. This is definitely a higher-end palette, &amp; the price reflects that. Each shadow pan holds below an average amount of shadow. I don't think anybody would find difficulty in storing this palette.

......

▪️If you are interested in this palette, I have a neutral opinion on it (due to it not being my style):

+ no gradients, no layering of shades

+ very easy to blend

+ gives you options for simple looks

......

+ Favorite Shade: Flourish

- Least Favorite Shade: Sunkissed

......

🚦 Rating: C

......

⭐ RATING LEGEND:

A = totally wow'd me

B = not the best, but I like it

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product

D = this didn't work out for me

F = I totally hate this

However they test on animals and i also prefer bullet lipsticks because of my dry lips. Does anyone have tips for cruelty free, affordable lipsticks with a wide (red) shade range?

* primer and setting spray
* if I use bronzer and highlighter in stick, can I apply brozer powder and the end?

I've been thinking about buying a powder foundation. I wear a mask all day and I move around a lot as I'm a teacher. My days are quite hectic, to be honest! 

My skin type is combo, very oily in my nose and my chin and kind of in my forehead. I don't have any marks or spots, although I do have vitiligo in one eye – that's a tough one to cover. 

I've heard very good things about these two foundations, but I'm not sure which one to buy. I like a natural-looking finish. I hate that cakey, powdery look on the skin. I don't want to look like a dusty piece of furniture. 🤣

Can you help me out?

Thanks a lot,

However when I used Revlon Colorstay foundation, breakouts started to happen on the side of my face and my chin. I do consider the fact that there may be other factors other than the foundation that may have caused it. However, as a precaution, should I stop using it?

Edit: I just got boosted before the weekend + I take BCP too but it never caused me to breakout before."

My skin gets oily around my T zone but I still have dry patches that foundations tend to cling to. 


What I’ve tried already:
Fenty pro filt’r- too heavy and clung to dry spots

Tarte amazonian clay- too heavy and it separated all over my skin

Too faced born this way- made my skin so greasy within the first few hours

Too faced peach perfect- loved, maybe slightly on the heavier side but unfortunately discontinued

Tarte hydroflex serum foundation- probably the closest thing to my HG but I hate the packaging and the consistency is so water-like that it gets messy.

I’m 39 and never wear make up these days nothing at all. When I was a teenager in the 90s I had eye makeup, for a while but bored of it and I guess things have moved on. Is foundation even a thing any more?

I’m not bothered about make up in everyday situations but I play sax in a rock band and I think I could use something for a bit of definition on my face and eyes particularly when being filmed or photographed under lights. In that context I have a kind of non face that doesn’t match my stage persona if that makes sense? Mouth is a no go for obvs reasons and I wouldn’t want any gunk in my horn lol.

I don’t know where to start and tbh slightly scared of looking like a clown (more than usual). Sometimes play a big stage but quite often small and up close so typical stage make up is not quite the right thing either.

I’ve seen a few make up tutorials of course and I don’t even know what half that stuff is any more let alone gonna start slapping it on at random.

* Primer (Milk Hydrogrip OR Rare Beauty Illuminating Primer) 
* Cream blush and bronzer (ELF Putty blush and bronzer). I apply it using the ELF putty primer brush with the scrape/scoop at the end. Scrape some product out, warm it up on my hand with the brush and try to pat it on my face
* This is where I'll notice the splotchiness. I try to save it by blending a powder product on top (MUF Blush and bronzer) but to no avail

📌 Lancôme - Bi-Facil Double-Action Eye Makeup Remover 


▪️ Why: I've had this sitting in my drawer, &amp; why I've only discovered it JUST this month is beyond me! This a dual-phase remover, so you need to give it a good 'shake' before use! I prefer using a disposable cotton round with this, as I've tried the reusable ones &amp; they just don't sustain the formula in the best way. The remover easily pours out of the top dispenser. I take the dowsed cotton pad, &amp; apply it directly to my eye &amp; let it sit there for about 30 seconds to loosen up all of the stuck-on makeup. After that, I ever-so-gently swipe around, &amp; this remover gets it ALL! Even the harshest of lash glue, eyeliner, &amp; mascara - it quickly dissolves it! This is the most effective, powerful makeup remover I've ever used, &amp; it's extremely nonabrasive. It's formulated for even the most-sensitive of eyes. This is something that I rely on, &amp; have been using every single night!


💰 Price: $32.00 • (Sephora)

📌 Ipsy Refreshments - Cleansing Face Wipes 


▪️ Why: I love a makeup wipe as the first-step in my nightly triple cleanse. I use the wipe to get off the first layer of makeup, that sits upon the surface of the skin. Further, I go in with a cleansing balm, &amp; a finishing cleanser. However, nothing is a greater workhorse than a tried-and-true makeup wipe. What I really like about these, is that they get delivered to your door every single month, so you are never without! You get 30 per pack, and that's a decent amount if you're just using them as a pre-cleanse. The wipes are an appropriate size, giving me enough room to adequately remove a full-face worth of product. I haven't noticed an obnoxious scent with them, they've just been pleasant. Lastly (but certainly not least), they are biodegradable - so when I'm done using them, I toss them in my huge compost bin so they can naturally breakdown. 


💰 Price: Foundation - $9.00 • (Ipsy)

......

📌 L'Oréal - Infallible Pro Glow Foundation 


▪️ Why: I know this foundation is an oldie, but I just recently tested it out earlier this month. Since then, I've snuck it into my 'Every Day Makeup Stash' &amp; cannot...put...it...down! I've worn it more often than my three other foundation picks this month, &amp; there's a reason why. When I wear this, I feel B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L. It smoothes over &amp; perfects the skin in such a way that even my most luxurious foundations cannot attain. Since this is a more of a fluid compound, I found the easiest &amp; most effective way to apply it is with my fingertips. The finish is so strikingly perfect; a subtle, natural-looking glow. I cannot believe this foundation is so unbelievably affordable for such a high-quality product. This is something I'm going to keep in my makeup arsenal for as long as it's available. To apply this product is an instant confidence boost.

📌 L'Oréal - Hydra Perfecte Perfecting Loose Powder 


▪️ Why: This is another older product, that I've only just discovered this month. WHY aren't more people talking about this splendiferous powder!? This product is COMPLETELY indistinguishable from a luxury product (easily costing quintuple the amount) in its look, function, &amp; wear. The powder itself is super soft. It's a very pleasant feeling upon the skin. However, my vigor is with the finish. It has the most soft-glow to it, like you are illuminated by candlelight. This product is ideal for any 'powder' step in your makeup routine. I've used it to set under my eyes, as a total face setting powder, as well as a buffing finishing powder. It is impeccable in all manners. Out of the many powders in my makeup collection, this is my FAVORITE one. There are two possible downsides to it, though. The first is that it is quite messy. The actual componentry isn't the most optimal for a powder. Secondly, it has a very pronounced 'soap' scent. If you are sensitive to fragrance, this might be considerably sensorial for you.

1643743368,Makeup,Florasis: Impression of Dai Forest Aura eyeshadow palette review!,"I thought I'd share my thoughts after having spent yesterday and today playing with the Forest Aura eyeshadow palette. I also picked up the Impression of Dai face powder and the Love Lock lipstick in taupe.  


The Forest Aura Eye Palette has exquisite packaging, definitely a collector's item, but I'd say it's overpriced, though the shimmers do feel uniquely luxurious and beautiful. You're buying for the crazy packaging and gorgeous pressing, which you will immediately ruin upon use lol. The quality is decent, but most of the colors are very, VERY shimmery and the palette itself does not include a good neutral matte. I'd say it requires medium skill to use, as the colors require building and if you go too heavy-handed it can quickly become a glittery mess. The two mattes (a red clay and a more neutral clay) are very forgiving and buildable, and I'd say overall the formula quality is buttery smooth. I got much better results using my fingers to press on the main golden shimmer tone and it is so, so flattering, and all the colors blend very nicely together. Maybe even a little TOO nicely together, as nothing stands out, not even the dot of bright green color. This palette is definitely well-suited for a fall color palette.   


Overall, the makeup looks I've been able to create with this have been very flattering but are all very subtle. You could build up the reddish clays and browns for a more dramatic autumnal look, and I do love that the largest palette is the gold shimmer, which I will probably swatch with EVERYTHING, but by itself the average look you'd get out of this is subtle and shimmery. That being said, Asian beauty standards usually call for more subtle, shimmery looks so this is in line with what I'd expect from a Chinese brand. One of the sample pics on the product page shows one makeup model sporting a bright green band using the green dot color--but that is a LIE. That green is more like a glitter, and there is so little of it I couldn't fathom how you could achieve that look realistically. I don't know if I'd buy another eyeshadow palette from Florasis based on this experience, but I will enjoy the heck out of this one and appreciate how beautiful it is.   


I was very pleased with both the face powder and the lipstick. The face powder was not drying at all, and is very similar to Shiseido formulations in being absolutely invisible while providing a subtle blurring effect. Definitely not for coverage or any heavy-duty setting, but perfect for touch-ups or for days you're going for a more soft, natural look.   


The Love Lock lipstick formulation is a little drying, but despite going on like a lipstick, instantly diffused for a soft, blotted lip look without me actually having to put the work into making it look that way lol. I only ordered the taupe, which looked very soft and natural on me (I'm Asian with medium skin tone) but I'm curious enough that I'd consider ordering a darker shade. As long as I make sure to swipe chapstick underneath, I feel it looks pretty fantastic, and again, the packaging is RIDICULOUS and so so extra, I love it. In all honesty, I think you can get a similar lip look with Sephora's $12 lip blotting mousse, so like with all of these products, definitely overpriced but I think you pick these up for the novelty/lux factor vs for the actual products themselves.   


Hope this helps folks on the fence about this brand!"

I feel really really guilty for saying this but buying all cruelty free stuff is getting difficult for me.

I hope people get what I’m saying, and if you are in my boat I feel you.

I've watched countless videos trying to solve this problem but my under eyes always look so awful. I'm at the point I won't even wear makeup because I'm so embarrassed by how they look even when the rest of my face looks just fine. I always cleanse, moisturize, and prime. I start with the concealer by applying it and blending it with a dampened makeup sponge. For setting the area I've tried both setting powder and setting spray on my beauty sponge and pressed lightly on top of the concealer. Both methods have provided a terrible result, I somehow make it look cakey and blotchy at the same time. I love makeup and enjoy wearing it but I'm always so self conscious of how that area looks, especially considering I wear a mask at work so that's really the only part that's seen. 

For reference I'm using Tarte Shape Tape concealer but have tried many brands and still produce the same result. I also use many different primers and setting powders/spray, all with the same result. Currently using Milani Rose Primer (don't love it but I hate being wasteful) and FitMe Maybelline setting powder, and if I use spray I've been using Makeup Forever Setting Spray.

So, my question is, what is face primer used for and would I benefit from using it?

Another thing, I've noticed that if I layer lotion, face powder, and then blush/bronze/contour in powder form it tends to get very tacky by some bits of ex blush sticking to the lotion. So I tend to only get lotion where my concealer goes. But if I had face primer all over my face and powder on top, could I layer blush on that without that issue?"

- I’m having trouble deciding what, if anything, to do with my lips??? I’m hesitant to do anything that accentuates them because of how thin and small my mouth is. In my inexperienced mind, that means a small amount of gloss or stain or something? 

- As for the rest of my face, I’m not really interested in doing anything with primer or foundation or anything like that...sounds expensive, and messy 😅but!! The idea of a tiny bit of highlighter seems cute? Haha, I know I said subtle, but still.

With how controversial Jeffree is, I feel a bit weird using his product. Is this weird or an understandable thing? What would you do if you were in my shoes? I'm around halfway through the pan and I want to be done with it already but the hefty price tag is making me want to use it all up since I'm only 20 and don't make that much money.

➡️ NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding the product quality. As always, use/buy the makeup that makes YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun.

......

For this specific post, I went through the archives of ALL the products I've tested &amp; reviewed this year. Then (from the archives), I chose the 'Top 6' most stand-out, remarkable beauty products that have completely made a difference in my routine. These named beauty products have been tried-and-true, thoroughly tested, &amp; have proven themselves through consistent use.

📌 Physician's Formula - Butter Believe It! Foundation + Concealer 


▪️ Why: I did a full 12-hour wear-test on this, &amp; it far surpassed my expectations. This foundation DOESN'T budge. It stays in place all day long, looks flawless, &amp; applies well with any application method of your choosing. This has been my all-year 'hero' foundation, easily beating even high-end competitors. Where I live is hot, humid, &amp; yuck - &amp; this foundation wears great for longer outdoor time periods where you may experience some sweating. It didn't break up on me after physical activity. 


🕶 Shade: Light-to-Medium

💰 Price: $11.77 • (Amazon)

......

📌 Kiko Milano - Green Me Brow Pencil 


▪️ Why: I've been raving about this all year long! It's my top favorite brow pencil in my current collection. Although it's a 'sharpenable' style pencil, the formula is superb &amp; the color is spot-on. If I keep it sharpened, I can achieve crisp-looking lines &amp; a fully-blended color. It's so very smooth, not waxy, &amp; perfectly pigmented. It comes complete with attached spoolie. 


🕶 Shade: 101

💰 Price: $6.30 • [SALE] • (Kiko Milano)

......

📌 ABH/Norvina Cosmetics - Eyeshadow Palette Formula 


▪️ Why: My God, I don't think I've ever been so in love with an eyeshadow formula! Granted, I haven't tried EVERY single palette, but the ones that I have tried were simply amazing, &amp; had me coming back for more. Albeit an extremely pigmented formula, it blends out with perfection - making difficult gradients a thing of the past. With all of the neat, unique color-stories, you are bound to just get creative &amp; create some really incredible looks. The metallics are beautiful, the light colors don't blend away, &amp; it wears spectacularly over the course of the day. 


💰 Price: $29.00 - $60.00 • (Sephora)

......

📌 L'Oréal - Infallible Long Wear Eye Pencil 


▪️ Why: I know this is such a simple (&amp; slightly boring) product to give an award to, but damn - have I had trouble finding a solid, reliable black eyeliner! The first time I used this, I loved the slick, gel formula. After wearing it multiple times between my upper lashes, I found it to never, ever transfer to the surrounding areas. It never gooped in the corners. This eyeliner stays in place! It wears especially well - lasting me all day long, &amp; even being slightly resistant to removal at the end of a long day! It does come off (without scrubbing) with an oil-based remover. This has been my ride-or-die black eyeliner this year, &amp; I'm so glad I came across it. 


🕶 Shade: Black

💰 Price: $8.99 • (Ulta)

......

📌 Essence Cosmetics - Lipsticks 


▪️ Why: I'm not opposed to dropping some money on a good lipstick, but WHY do that when Essence only asks a tiny fraction of the price for an outstanding product? I've put these lipsticks through some extreme wear, &amp; they last better than Pat McGrath, equivalent to Charlotte Tilbury. For $1.99. The colors in their 'This is Nude' line are so beautiful, the wear-time is seriously on-point, &amp; the formula itself ... it FEELS so high-end. It is an absolute pleasure to use these lipsticks, &amp; I love the duality of wearing a great lipstick that is an ACTUAL value product. 


🕶 Shade: all of them! (01 freaky)

💰 Price: $1.99 • (Ulta)

📌 HealFast - Beauty Supplement 


▪️ Why: I know not everyone is a 'supplement person', but for those of you who are - this is a must-have beauty supplement. I've been taking this one for the last few months, &amp; the changes it's made are undeniable. A lot of beauty supplements 'claim' to do things (&amp; I've tried &amp; tested them with little to no results), but THIS one is giving me the hair/skin/nails results that I have been searching for, for YEARS. It was formulated by actual physicians (which is a great keypoint for me when I look for something like this). I buy a bottle each time I'm halfway through my current one so I don't ever run out. The label says to take 5 capsules daily, but I only dose 2 capsules at nighttime, &amp; have STILL seen mega results. If you have been looking for something that actually works, this is IT!

Usually when I get a slight tan, it's fine and everything matches well, as my tan shade is a warm yellowish undertone. But summer in Eastern Europe isn't really a thing, so my tan lasts for only a few months. And then I'm left looking like a human rainbow..."
1641059226,Makeup,Dupe for Laura Mercier secret camo,"I really love this concealer and have used it for years but as I wear less and less makeup I notice breaks me out. The day after using it I will get a new blemish. I don’t care about price point just want to try something else to see if maybe there is an ingredient that is clogging my pores or aggravating my rosacea in the LM one by trying something new.

I will be using this for covering blemishes."
1641059275,Makeup,"If my liquid liner is always a crunchy, jagged line: Is it me? Or is it the product?","I’ve been wondering this recently and hoping I could get some advice.

I just recently started wearing makeup a few months ago, so I’m a bit of a beginner. I am an artist so I have steady hands and a decently good eye for shape and matching the two sides and all that good stuff. But recently I’ve realized my line across my eyelid is literally always kind of rough. The actual wing part is usually fine, but the eyelid.. yikes

I was wondering if it could have something to do with the product? Is there big differences between liquid liner and their applicators? What liner products do you guys really like? It very well could just be me being a beginner, but I’ve been doing my makeup often since I started and I’ve improved on literally everything else but that, so I’m just curious."

1641064090,Makeup,Advice on blush (healthy look) for men,"Hi, I am a man of 26. When I have been exercising I always look so 'healthy', color on my cheekbones. My girlfriend came up with the advice to use blush sometimes if I want to look like this more often. And why not (we live in 2022 right haha, happy new year btw)? So I want to try it. Only I'm not that familiar yet in the makeup world, my girlfriend not really either.

Can you guys recommend me a brand/type?

1641076795,Makeup,What’s happening to my foundation? Why does it look like this?,"I’m having troubles with my foundation and no matter what I do nothing ever helps. I honestly give up with wearing makeup all together it’s that hideous. I’ll obviously include a picture below.
I’ve tried changing my skincare routine I don’t think it’s my skin as my skin is pretty clear just a lil red due to past acne scarring. I’ve tried different primers, foundations, concealers, brushes, beauty sponges, even tried using my hands. I always prep my skin beforehand. Even tried watching YouTube tutorials and copying peoples techniques and advice. Tried switching foundation shades even undertones. 
I thought it was maybe because my foundation is darker than my face but tried a lighter foundation and it still did it. I like to match my foundation to my neck &amp; body as I’m naturally tanned my face is light compared to them. Any advice please? [foundation](https://imgur.com/a/ELGERiJ)


I’ve tried Nars, Estée Lauder, Fenty, huda beauty, drugstore foundations, Armani, you name it I’ve tried it. 
Even contouring and concealing removes my foundation"

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️Patchiness: no patchiness 


🔸️Blendability: easy to blend out 


🔸️Fallout: only experienced fall-out from the metallic shades, the most being from 'Blue Cheese' 


🔸️Shade Variance: this palette really doesn't have the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I look for, every shade in this palette is a mid-tone, making a complete look really difficult.  There are 2 traditional neutral transition shades included in this particular color-story, which may work for a range of skintones. The formula balance ratio in this palette is 10:6 (mattes to metallics), &amp; I think a 63% / 37% formula split is a heavy on the mattes. There is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. There were no 'dud' shades in this palette. 


🔸️Formula: 


MATTES: something I noticed about this matte formula is that they are not all made the same. Some of them are super creamy &amp; soft, while others are stiff, chalky, &amp; dry. It's a vast difference between all the mattes, which really did surprise me. I didn't really gave any issues actually working with these, but in my experience - they are more 'buildable' shades, applying slightly lighter in pigment &amp; require layering for intensity. 


METALLICS: the metallics are great! Each individual one in this color-story has a base pigment, so you can use them in all sorts of ways. They are very soft &amp; malleable - gliding right onto the surface with a simple brush. I found two of the metallics to have almost a 'duochrome' finish to them, which makes them quite interesting. 

......

🔸️Packaging: No doubt GlamLite has some interesting packaging. It's always completely on theme &amp; well thought-out. This particular packaging is very unique, &amp; would make a great palette for a person who loves packaging.

......

🔸️Recommendation: this palette was my first introduction into actual GlamLite territory - never having tried any of their branded food-themed products. I was intrigued by the entirety of the experience - actually holding this thing in my hands, &amp; getting to work with this hyped formula. I really enjoy bold, bright colors - but, I find this particular color-story very one-noted &amp; difficult to create a cohesive look with. I think this palette is best suited for the collector, or somebody who only wears one-shadow looks. The price per shade is 'excellent'. Each shadow pan holds above an average amount of shadow. I think some people may find difficulty in storing this palette, due to its irregular size &amp; shape. 


▪️If you are interested in this palette, I would NOT recommend it for 3 reasons: 

+ all the shades are mid-tones

+ unbalanced formula ratio

+ packaging is difficult to store

......

+ Favorite Shade: 1000 EYEland

- Least Favorite Shade: Onion Rings

......

🚦 Rating: C

1641083369,Makeup,"Advice Needed, Please Help!","I could really use some help from y’all! My beautiful wife has really been having a rough time with her anxiety and depression, and it has recently gotten to the point where she is staying at an all women’s mental health center to try to get the help she needs to begin to feel better. She LOVES doing her makeup everyday, and playing with it when she has free time. We are currently living with roommates with a very small bedroom and shared bathroom, so her “vanity” space is limited to the top of her dresser in front of the window, with all her supplies and a small mirror squeezed in. I really want to try to get her area as nice, and organized as I can to give her a little more space for her before she comes home. Any suggestions of small makeup storage drawers or advice on how to make the top of her dresser into a nice vanity set up! Thank you all in advance! Any help is beyond appreciated!!"
1641090611,Makeup,High end loose powder and concealer for a woman who resembles a carton of milk?,"So I've recently gotten back into makeup after a huge makeup slump of 4 years due to college and having to wear masks. For 2022, I want to get back into it but I always used to use only drugstore as I was a 13-16 year old the last time I wore makeup full time and obviously couldn't afford high end. I turn 21 this year and I want to have better quality products. I already have some Mac lipsticks, a Mac primer which works really well with my skin, a highlighter, foundation and an eyeshadow pallette which I am still waiting for in the mail. Since I live in the UK, it's kind of hard to get my hands on high end makeup. It's only sold online or at Boots and Harvey Nichols which are like atleast 4 hours away from me so it's no good every time I want to go makeup shopping so online is my best bet really so that means I can't really use a tester before buying something and I hate having to send stuff back if it doesn't work out. My skin is super pale. Almost as pale as a milk carton (hence the title 😂) so a lot of foundations and skin products just are too dark. I've never found a foundation that is light enough for me. The best foundation I've found is the Urban Decay All Nighter in the lightest shade. It's still a smidge too dark but it's the best I've found. I'm currently in need of a new concealer and powder as the concealer doesn't cover as much as it needs to and the powder is just too messy for me. I've never known such a messy powder ever. These two products are the conceal and define concealer by Revolution In the shade 0.5 and the powder is Rimmel match perfection in translucent. I will obviously use these up before I buy more makeup because I spent money on them and I don't like wasting money but I want to research into what would be the best option for me in terms of high end loose powder and concealer that will actually work for my pale skin. For context, my skin is combination so matte and dewy both work well for my skin. 

Thanks."

My question is does anyone have any recommendations where I can find something just like it? I thought MAC or Anastasia Beverly hills. Im about to go try to find it and I was wondering if anyone knows if Mac or sephora or ulta would be better? I don't want to waste a one of the team members time there to help me find something they might not have.. maybe I'm just paranoid. Help? What should I do about finding it?

1641154223,Makeup,DIY Wedding Day Makeup Advice,"Hi everyone! So I’m eloping to Tulum and having a ceremony with just my fiancé and I. We will have a photographer but I’ve opted out of getting professional hair and makeup done. This is mainly because anytime I get my makeup and hair done professionally I hate it and end up washing it off/doing it myself. I decided that I didn’t want to even second guess this on my special day so I’ll do what makes me feel comfortable. 

My wedding planner has advised against this because of the humidity in Mexico. I don’t really worry about this because I grew up/live in Georgia and South Carolina where the humidity is extremely high. I’ve compared the levels and I can’t imagine it being that much different than a very humid day here. 

What makeup would you all recommend for a humid climate that will stay in place?! I do not usually wear full coverage foundation. Right now I switch between Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and Nars sheer glow foundation when I want a little more coverage. I usually set with urban decay spray after translucent powder. I’m opening to spending good money on products to make sure my makeup looks amazing in our photos!

In 2020 I got into makeup, it started with glossier and burts bees. I used the cloud paint, boy brow, and the stick highlighter, I felt pretty good. In December of 2021 I got into eyeshadow. I used the cloud paint as eyeshadow and I really enjoyed it. It made me excited to try out new eye makeup, so I bought the mini love palette by Natasha denona. I was honestly dreading using the palette because I don’t want to wreck it haha. Maybe it was the brushes I used (almost 10 year old quo ones borrowed from my mum) or the fact that I’m very new to powder products, the look turned out to be a bit of a mess. You could hardly see the shadow, there was glitter everywhere and my eyelids felt sore. The brushes were very prickly and my eyes still hurt :(. I think I’ll put the palette down for a while and see if I can get some liquid or cream shadows. What are your favourite eye brushes to use? Is there a way to make the powder shadows more manageable to use? If you have round eyes or have eyes that don’t show much lid when you look straight, any tips?"

1638030270,Makeup,Full Coverage Foundation &amp; Concealer,Talk to me about full coverage foundation &amp; concealers. I've been using Tarte's Shape Tape on my entire face because I love the smooth look and the blending between my face &amp; under eye area.

1638032715,Makeup,Eyeliner tips for “Phoenix Eyes”??,"So I never wear eyeliner. It’s not because I don’t want to or don’t know how, it’s just that I couldn’t find a style that was flattering to my eye shape. I looked through many different types but I couldn’t find any similar to mine. The best way I can explain my eye shape is like a mix between monolid and almond. I’m part Chinese so I decided to look into East Asian eye shapes and finally found the phoenix eye. It’s the one that resembles my eyes the best but apparently it’s not a very common shape. So I’m having a hard time finding good eye makeup tips. If there’s anyone who’s familiar with East Asian makeup/phoenix eyes, that would be greatly appreciated! For reference, these are some pics I found of the phoenix eye and a pic of my own eye (sorry for the bad quality lol)

1638045035,Makeup,Charlotte Tilbury Is it worth the hype update,"So Im not sure if any of you saw it but a few days ago I created a post and asked if CT was worth the hype because I was interested in the brand just iffy on the price of it. 

I ended up getting three things to test the brand out and here were my thoughts.

The airbrush powder: I really did like it no complaints it is a good powder. The formula though I know I can find at least 2 cheaper dupes for. 

The cheat lip liner in iconic nude: Probably my favorite formula for a lip liner ever and the shade is super flattering! Honestly my favorite thing out of everything I got from CT.

Pillow Talk matte lipstick: A little disappointed in the formula. I feel like Pillowtalk is the main staple of the brand so wanted to try it out. the formula definitely settled into every fine line on my lips. I feel like MAC lipsticks are cheaper and very similar but better in terms of performance."

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️Patchiness: no patchiness 


🔸️Blendability: easy to blend out 


🔸️Fallout: experienced some fallout, the most being from shimmer shade 'tonic' 


🔸️Shade Variance: this palette has a very nice 'light-to-dark' gradient. There are a few neutral transition shades, which may work for a broad range of skintones. The formula balance ratio in this palette is 13:15 (mattes to shimmers), &amp; I'm happy with a 43%/50% formula split; I think it provides enough balance. There is a matte black in this palette, which I always like - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. I didn't run into any duds with this palette. 


🔸️Formula: 


MATTES: the matte formula is what makes Sample Beauty really stand out. They are just simply good mattes. They easily work in your favor, not having to coerce them to function well. They blend, build, &amp; layer nicely. I also enjoy the nice range of blending mattes provided in this palette, so it's easy to create gradients. 


SHIMMERS: the shimmers are just basic. I didn't run into any that blew my mind, but none were awful. They just looked and performed like you would expect a standard shimmer to behave. I really like that a shimmer is provided to match each matte, so the looks created can be monochromatic. 


SEQUINS: there are only two of these in this palette, &amp; they are easily identifiable. They both have a completely matte base, but also have pinpoint reflects blended in - making it a bit more interesting. These shades can be used in the same way as a normal matte shadow, as the sparkly reflects don't really stay in place, &amp; kind of just fall away as you blend them. 


MATTE BLACK: this is a good one; having both the depth &amp; saturation I look for. It's very true-to-color, &amp; an excellent addition to this color-story.

......

🔸️Packaging: pretty boring; I don't think the exterior packaging really matches the contents of the actual palette. 

......

🔸️Recommendation: This is one of those palettes where there are SO many looks to be created, that it's almost overwhelming to know where to start. It has every primary color, plus some great blending shades. Not all rainbow palettes are well-done, but this one definitely is! Also, I wanted to point out that this is the CHEAPEST palette (by shade &amp; per gram) that I've ever reviewed! I can't believe what a great deal it is! The price per shade is 'excellent' when compared to market price. Each shadow pan holds an above-average amount of shadow. I don't think anybody would find difficulty in storing this palette. 


▪️If you are interested in this palette, I would definitely recommend it for 3 reasons: 

+ very easy to work with

+ endless amount of creative possibilities 

+ very large color-story in minimal space 

......

+ Favorite Shade: Eve

- Least Favorite Shade: Base

......

🚦 Rating: A

I definitely need setting powder as I also tend to sweat but I don't know if it'll be alright to put cream products (bronzer, highlighter, blush) on top of it if it will just separate.

That being said, I have a fancy dress Christmas party in a couple of weeks, bought a sparkly black dress and feel like I will look a little silly if I don’t put on even minimal make up, so here I am lol. 
I know literally nothing about anything. I have very fair skin, red hair and freckles. Do you have any suggestions for eye shadow, lip gloss vs lipstick, should I put on some sort of blush if I’m not using foundation? 
I’m trying to look natural especially since it will look very obvious to everyone that I am wearing make up since I NEVER do.

1638122228,Makeup,How do I get my makeup to look professionally done?,"Hi everyone! New here.

Recently I have started to do my own makeup. Right now I am more focused on the face and not so much on the eyes. I obviously don’t have that much experience so I think this is were the first issue starts. Okay so I watch a bunch of MUA videos and videos on them doing clients makeup. I notice that the face will look professionally done and when I do my own makeup it looks like I don’t even have makeup on. 

Now don’t get me wrong I know some love natural makeup but at times I want the dramatic look. I’m pretty light/pale skinned so I can’t really go ham on the contour/bronzer lol. Not sure if that’s the issue because I would love to also have a much more bronzed face without it looking too harsh.

 I know I probably don’t make any sense but I would love for my makeup to look I guess very noticeable. How do I achieve that? I have oily skin but I sort of hate matte foundations and love the shinny look too."

1638215904,Makeup,Tips for eyeshadow for multiple creases in eyelid,"Hi, so I have about 2 creases (and therefore 3 eyelids/spaces) which makes eyeshadow crease not only a certain but it then creases in 2 places. And to add to that I have hooded eyes so already the space is limited

I’ve got some pretty decent eye primer and I’ve tried so many different combos of either primer alone or with concealer +/- setting spray but even as I apply I see the eyeshadow gathering at the creases. 

Any advice - either a fool proof way to handle this or ways to wear eyeshadow that maybe is simpler and doesn’t require much lid space?

The other foundation is conceal and hydrate, but there’s still like 3/4 of a bottle left.
At the moment I’m not really interested in trying to find a replacement foundation, I love the way the mixture works and it’s the first time foundation has actually matched my skin, usually the shade is slightly off, or the undertone is wrong, or it doesn’t sit right on my skin if I am lucky enough to find a match.

For some background info, I start my mornings washing my face, applying vitamin C serum, and started using a night cream as a moisturizer wasn’t enough for my dry skin. I then apply It Cosmetics primer followed by their CC cream with a wet Beauty Blender.

1638446332,Makeup,Need help with a choice for my partner,"  

Hi Makeup reddit! 

My partner always tells me about make-up and asked me so many times about advent calendar I want to pick one for her. I know make-up semi well, but I help with the following problem:  
 The problem is I am stuck between 2 calendars. She is already a make-up fan. We have things ranging from Morphe, Two faced and Urban decay. (smashbox,naked,revolution) 

Now I have found 2 calendars I think match her vibe the most, but I am stuck... I need a second (and more) opinion.... 

The choice is between:   
 **Makeup Revolution The Ultimate Glamour Collection 12 Day Advent Calendar**   
 and   
 **Makeup Revolution x Friends 12 Days Of Christmas Advent Calendar** 

The problem is she is not a Friends fan, she loves shimmers and I am wondering if any of you have experience what swatches the best, good pigmentation and more! Any advice will be appreciated"

I've always had long lashes and narrow eyes, but for the past couple of years I've been on eye drops with the side effect of making eyes darker, deeper set, and eyelash growth (when the optometrist told me that he then paused, looked at me, and added 'not that anyone would be able to tell the difference with you').  By this point my lashes have certainly gotten longer, and I have two issues.

1) they clump together a lot.  I think some is the drops leaking out of my eyes onto them, maybe some is just natural stickiness?  I try rinsing them off when I'm washing my face but that just reduces the clumping some.  Any suggestions on the best way to fight clumping?

2) They are kind of uneven, like the outer half of the top droops over my eye like a curtain often, but the inner part is more up, the lengths are not even, and they just look sort of unkempt.  Is there such thing as eyelash trimming?  Or combing?  Or something I should be doing to keep these at least looking respectable (and maybe less noticeable)?"

👉 Milani - Conceal + Perfect Smooth Finish Cream-to-Powder Foundation 


First-Impression Review: This is a foundation BALM, akin to the infamous KVD Vegan Beauty 'Good Apple' foundation. Right away, I found it difficult to get a good shade match, because you can't readily add any mixers into a balm. This is a silicone-based foundation, with 'dimethicone' being the first listed ingredient. To this, I anticipated a very smooth, pore-filling type of look. There is no fragrance to this formula, &amp; it is housed in a cute compact. To the touch, the texture feels very smooth, &amp; almost resistant. The consistency is very slippery, &amp; you can feel the transformation of cream-to-powder on your fingertips. Upon use, I found this to result in a 'skin perfecting' look. I applied it with a dense foundation brush, &amp; ended up with a natural, satin finish. This foundation is not self-setting, &amp; definitely feels like it needs to be set in place. It looks slightly heavy as I look close-up, &amp; I achieved a medium coverage level. However, you can get full-coverage if you continually build it up. I think normal/oily/combo skin types would most benefit from this.

👉 Covergirl - Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer 


First-Impression Review: I've had my eye on this concealer since it's launch, &amp; I'm very excited to test it out today. This is supposed to be a 'hydrating' concealer with a totally vegan composition. I found it to have a very subtle 'makeup-like' scent to it. The concealer is housed in a tube with a small doefoot applicator. The texture of the formula is very soft &amp; unstructured. The consistency is very runny, &amp; serum-like. I applied it with a dense concealer brush, &amp; found it to be incredibly easy to blend-out. Immediately after dry-down, it felt very light on my skin, like I wasn't wearing makeup at all. It resulted in a very dewy, glowing undereye look. I didn't find it to crease on me at all.  I achieved light coverage with this concealer, &amp; feel that it would be a great formula to consider for 'no-makeup' makeup days. I think dry/normal/combo skin would most benefit from this concealer.

👉 Shop Miss A - Amuse Face Palette 


First-Impression Review: I just recently showcased this palette in a video, &amp; there was a lot of interest in it! I figured I'd include it today, &amp; take a more in-depth look at it. This palette contains three products: bronzer, blush, &amp; highlight. I prefer a face palette that accomplishes at least two steps, &amp; this one can fulfill three. Although slightly dark, I can make the highlight shade work on my skintone if I use it in a diffused method. Both the bronzer &amp; blushes suit me very well. All included powders have excellent blendability &amp; pigmentation. As for the actual pan sizes, I find them to be too narrow to fit my entire brush without accidentally dipping into a neighboring shade. Looking at color differentiation - I find that the blush shades are extremely similar, almost not warranting both to be in the same palette. Considering the price - I find that overall, it's a great deal.

👉 Item Beauty - Brow Chow Ultra-Fine Brow Definer 


First-Impression Review: I love, LOVE testing out brow products! Honestly, when I took a close look at this one, I thought I was going to struggle immensely. However, this was the biggest surprise of the day - this pencil worked great! It is a brow 'definer', &amp; usually definer pencils feature a large, triangular tip. On the backend, it has a miniature capped smoothing brush. Upon use, I found this pencil to be extremely smooth. It was instantaneously pigmented, too - it didn't require being built-up in order to see it.  I didn't find this formula to be overly waxy, either. Even though the tip is kind of large, if you use the edge of it, it IS able to create thin, hairlike strokes. The color I selected was also what I usually aim for.

👉 Shop Miss A - AOA Studio Eyeshadow Quad 


First-Impression Review: I've never tried any eyeshadows from Shop Miss A, so I just grabbed a quad to test out the formula. This palette doesn't have the nice 'light to dark' gradient that I look for - each shade is just a midtone. This entire palette is 75% matte &amp; 25% topper, &amp; I think it's too matte-heavy for me. I would like to see more balance. The matte shadows are all very, very similar - especially when applied to the eye.  The topper shade doesn't have a base pigment, so you are very limited as to how to use it. Upon use, I didn't get any creasing or patchiness. I got a LOT of kickback in the pans &amp; fall-out on my face.  I found all the shadows to be very easy to blend-out &amp; layer. This is a more directly pigmented formula, meaning as soon as you apply it, you are going to see the color. I personally would use a palette like this for a 'no-makeup' makeup look, with only slight sculpting. It's not my next go-to, but I still think it holds a place in my collection.

👉 Hard Candy - Flashers Plumping Serum 


First-Impression Review: I'm ALWAYS down to try a plumping gloss - the more tingling, the better. The consistency of this particular gloss is pretty thick; thick enough to form stiff peaks. There is a slight fragrance to this formula. The color that I chose is really pretty, it's an iridescent blue/purple (which is NOT good for the teeth). The applicator type is a plush paddle, &amp; I found it easy to use. Upon use, I needed to dip in the tube 4 times for my complete lip look. I found it to fill-in my lip lines, which is what I like for my glosses to do. There is also a slight stick to the finish, not terrible - but enough to promote a longer wear time. As far as the 'plumping' aspect, there was barely any tingling, &amp; I didn't notice any lip plumping results.

1638501942,Makeup,Buying makeup off of Amazon is mostly terrible,"I have Prime, so of course I use it bc I don’t have a ton of money. 

I only buy well known, quality brands but I keep getting products that are expired, about to expire, unsealed, etc. 

How do you make makeup buying on Amazon work?! Even if it’s from Amazon, there’s still a lot of issues."
1638502889,Makeup,does everyone just look crusty when they wear foundation or is that just me??,"really though, I take great care of my skin, exfoliate every few days, moisturize, get regular facials etc. I am a professional esthetician.  so if that means anything. I know that my skin is dry and needs a lot of moisture so thats what I give her.

I think my skin actually looks fine without foundation on, But some days If I want to dress up I do like to have a little extra coverage, especially if i am going to be drinking at all because I get really red in the face.

my only issue is, EVERY time I wear foundation it looks so CRUSTY. 

I have no idea if I am just overly critical of how it looks because i don't wear foundation much but it honestly looks gross up close. does every ones skin just look crusty up-close when they wear foundation??

&amp;#x200B;

for context:

 I put the foundation on and all the moisture has just been sucked out of my face and within a few seconds i am left with textured look that i absolutely can not stand. I have used more ""CC"" cream foundations as well and they are like almost too oily and leave my skin looking greasy patchy? its like all of the pores on my face fill with the foundation while every other area is just left uncovered. or  Its like not even really covering my skin so much as its sitting patchily on top of my face when you look up close.  it looks bad in my opinion so idk. I havent really noticed it on other women when I go out but I guess i am also not that close to their face so idk if I dont see it or if its just not an issue for them.

I generally do my face routine, lightly exfoliate, moisturize, let that dry for 20 min then apply my foundation with a moist beauty blender, but I have tried brushes, and fingers too and all just seem to end up looking the same. some times I use primer but that seems to not make much of a difference if I use it or not so I just dont bother lol"

1638567284,Makeup,Recommendations for a chartreuse lipstick? (that can also be found in Europe),"What I'm looking for is something similar to the lipstick shade that Jolyne from JJBA wears. I saw that J* has a lipstick called No Offense, but I don't feel comfortable buying from him so I'd rather find better alternatives. Where can I find such a shade? Should I just grab an eyeshadow and turn it into a lipstick?

I want something that can also be found in Europe, that is matte and not a gloss.

Thanks! Any other suggestions are welcomed!"

+ Amazon: 4.3 / 5.0 (95 ratings)

+ Ulta Beauty: 4.2 / 5.0 (2,027 ratings)

.............................

TOTAL AVERAGE RATING: 4.2 / 5.0

........

Initial Application: (1530) looks exactly the same on both sides (right side w/ curled lashes &amp; primer), dry formula, exceptionally pitch-black in color, no application mess, gave me superb volume, great length, didn't notice any curling, no clumping. The wand is quite large for the lower lashes.

........

🕑 2-Hour Mark: (1730) [still wearable] both sides just simply look 'worn'. Each side looks less lifted, like it already lost all of its initial volume. There are no smudges or flaking at this time.

........

🕒 3-Hour Mark: (1830) [still wearable] a few flakes around the entire right side (w/ curled lashes &amp; primer), the lashes themselves look the same as last check-in.

........

🕔 5-Hour Mark: (2030) [still wearable] some small flaking around both eyes now, both sides' lashes look the same as last check-in.

........

🕗 8-Hour Mark: (2330) [still wearable] same amount of flakes, but nothing noteworthy.

........

🧼 Micellar Water Test: PASS; came off very easily with simple micellar water. I soaked a cotton pad, applied &amp; massaged my lashes for 10-15 seconds, &amp; wiped clean.

........

🤓 Final Thoughts: 

▪️Flaking: flaking began at the 3-hr mark

▪️Transfer: no transfer at all 

▪️Packaging: cute, purple is my favorite color

▪️Brush: big &amp; tough to control

▪️Formula: dry formula, volumizing, not clumpy

▪️Value: using the 'average' amount of mascara to be 0.27 fl oz &amp; $10, this particular tube has 0.36 fl oz for $7. For an additional 0.09 fl oz of product, you are paying below the average price.

▪️Results: the mascara stayed lightweight &amp; relatively fluffed all day long, both sides lost their any sign of curl at the 2-hr mark.  

▪️Lower Lashline: no; brush is hard to maneuver for the lowers

▪️Recommend: yes; I think this mascara is good enough for an all-day, 8-hour wear with minimal repercussions.

Like every other NARS product I have ever owned, the compact has gone sticky and tacky thanks to that stupid rubberised coating they put on everything.

✅ New Saturday Palette Pictorial &amp; Review

......

➡️ NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding the palette quality. As always, use/buy the makeup that makes YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 


🌟 Also, this is my first time deep diving into this palette, &amp; are my true impressions. As I continue to use it in more ways, I will update you as to how my thoughts on its performance change/develop. 

......

ABH/Norvina Cosmetics - Pro Pigment Palette Vol. 2 ✌

......

......

⚫ Designation: rainbow-esque

......

⚫ Dexterity Concerns: yes; the magnet on this palette is very strong &amp; can be very difficult to open. Also the size &amp; weight of this palette is very trying to hold in the hands.

......

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️Patchiness: no patchiness 


🔸️Blendability: easy to blend out 


🔸️Fallout: experienced some fallout, the most being from matte shade 'C2' 


🔸️Shade Variance: this palette has a very nice 'light-to-dark' gradient. There are no traditional neutral transition shades included in this particular color-story. The formula balance ratio in this palette is 15:7 (mattes to metallics), &amp; I think a 60% / 28% formula split leans matte-heavy. There's not an equal formulation balance. There is a matte black in this palette, which I always like - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. I didn't run into any duds with this palette. 


🔸️Formula: 


MATTES: this matte formula is so nice. This is (hands-down) one of my FAVORITE matte formulas ever! It lies down very pigmented, &amp; it doesn't blend away (even the extremely light-toned shades). It's very easy to create a gradient with this palette. The shades layer very nicely, aren't patchy at all, &amp; are incredibly intense! 


METALLICS: these are far from the best metallics I've ever used, but they sure are pretty. There are some really rare colors in here. Some of the shades have a base pigment, &amp; other ones don't. I really enjoy the mixture. I also like that this palette isn't oversaturated with metallic shades. I also appreciate that they pick up well on a brush! 


SEQUINS: there are only three of these shades in here, &amp; they are very intensely pigmented shades with very tiny pinpoint glitters in them. The glitters aren't extremely noticeable, but they do catch the light if layered up nicely. I would consider this formula to be approached more as a 'satin', as that's how it practically functions. 


MATTE BLACK: this is a good one; having both the depth &amp; saturation I look for. It's very true-to-color, &amp; an excellent addition to this color-story.

......

🔸️Packaging: I really like this packaging. It keeps the shadows nicely protected, &amp; it looks pretty cool! I also think the exterior packaging matches the interior color-story.

......

🔸️Recommendation: This is a crazy color-story - it really doesn't make much sense. It makes creating looks much more fun, &amp; I feel inspired by this particular color-story. This was VERY fun to use, &amp; the quality was astounding. This has definitely made its way up into being one of my favorite palettes that I own. I love the quality of the Norvina formula so much, I am bound to collect all the palettes! The price per shade is 'excellent'. Each shadow pan holds an above average amount of shadow. You may find difficulty in storing this palette, due to its immense size. I am keeping this in my collection. 


▪️If you are interested in this palette, I would definitely recommend it for 3 reasons: 

+ incredibly easy to blend 

+ very inspiring color-story

+ inclusion of rare shades

1638646664,Makeup,Why have I never tried eyeshadows wet before?!?!,"Realized while watching makeup YouTube that I own several wet-to-dry formulas and I never thought to wet my brush cause I know the beauty YouTubers do it but it seemed like it would make the eyeshadow too intense. Tried it, love it, and it’s still “subtle” because the shadows I’m using are a satin, not a pow-highlight-glitter shade. It’s just more even, richer, and staying put more. 10/10, can’t stop looking at myself in the mirror, would recommend."

I have never used much eyeshadow before (except Kitten by Stila) because I have very hooded eyes.  I have watched a couple of tutorials and wanted to venture into using shadow differently.

I'm  not sure if the Bobbi Brown still makes this brush to the same quality,  I recently bought their eye sweep brush to replace my old one but the quality was so much worse than the same brush from 8 years ago.  It was very scratchy and had a completely different shape.  On the other hand, I also bought their eye blender brush at the same time and the quality is amazing, soft that it doesn't irritate my eyes and not too firm.  It seems Bobbi Brown's brush quality is hit or miss these days, so if someone has bought the Smokey Eye Liner brush in the recent years and could provide some feedback, that would be greatly appreciated.

My wife doesn’t do makeup, never has. We ha a friend who was able to help instruct with eyeshadow, and I’m not doing to bad there.

But the lipstick… it needs some Jesus.

Me and the friend went and bought some decent makeup, because the Halloween store stuff was just terrible.

Anyway, daughter is doing this unicorn rainbow fair princess costume? And so we ended up with this black radiance metallic purple lipstick. The problem… it’s weird and pointy like a crayon. Like, I’ve never seen any shaped like this. Neither has our family friend. And it’s throwing us all off.

Tried applying some… because you know, practice… but it’s all kinda jacked up. I don’t even know if it’s the shape or a general incompetence on my part.

I tried doing a YouTube tutorial search… but it’s more just reviews. And it’s like… how? How did you just get it to glide on perfectly like that?

my birthday is tomorrow and i didn't know until i went into an ulta near my moms place (near the beginning of the month) that as a platinum member i'm supposed to get a second birthday gift aside from the free item i already got.

so about 2 weeks ago i emailed ulta asking about what this second item was supposed to be. well the person who responded was very hush hush and secret about what i was supposed to get ""i'm really not supposed to tell you"" but he sent me a list of items platinum members get i then realized i should be getting a $10 off coupon... it's now the day before my birthday and the day before the last day to use that coupon, and it still hadn't arrived.

I got a little annoyed and started a chat with an ulta beauty specialist who sent me a code for a coupon and then weather on purpose or not deleted the code before i could copy it and ended the chat. obviously anything could change before tomorrow. but i suddenly understand why Sephora has so much support where i live despite the fact that ulta had more stores. 

anyway i just needed to rant about this experience cuz i think i need to step back from ulta at this stage. this is not the first time i've had bad service but i think it might be the last time i accept it from ulta. thank you for reading"

I have fair skin and currently use Revolution Pro foundation drops (I took a shade too dark so I think I'm F3). I have combination skin that starts shining within a few hours. I don't have big imperfections but tend to have some small blackheads or pimples sometimes. Mostly I'm super pale and just need a foundation that looks natural and healthy and unifies skin tone. I'm considering shade 0.5-2 in the serum or 1.5N in the original. Which one would work best?"

I am not looking for flashy and always have trouble picking good colors for me.  Nothing too pink, orange... I don't want to look like I have a color painted on my face. Even if it's a color, I want it to look like it belongs there

✅ New Saturday Palette Pictorial &amp; Review

......

➡️ NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding the palette quality. As always, use/buy the makeup that makes YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 


🌟 Also, this is my first time deep diving into this palette, &amp; are my true impressions. As I continue to use it in more ways, I will update you as to how my thoughts on its performance change/develop.

Morphe Brushes - The Jaclyn Hill Palette ✌

......

👁 Look Created: Spotlight Eye

......

⚫ Packaging: 35 shades are 1.6g each, circle-shaped pans, white cardboard packaging, bi-fold, palette brand &amp; name is on front, luxe-weight, magnetic closure, large rectangle shape, no mirror inside, pans may possibly be removable (currently waiting on testing tool to arrive for more definitive assessment), shade identification is designated on a completely separate cardstock insert, to which I taped inside the inner cover. Keep in mind that the NEWLY released version of this palette has the shade names printed southward of each shadow.

......

⚫ Country of Origin: China

......

⚫ # of Shades in Palette: 35 (all eyeshadows)

......

⚫ Formulas Included: 3 formulas (17 mattes, 3 satins, &amp; 15 shimmers) 

......

⚫ Designation: warm-toned, 'pop-of-blue'

......

⚫ Dexterity Concerns: none

......

⚫ Type of Press: soft - lots of kickback in pans, slight fallout on my face; recommend doing eyes first with this palette. 

......

⚫ Extra Information: created in collaboration with long-time Beauty Influencer Jaclyn Hill, each shade has a unique history &amp; descriptor, cruelty-free, NOT vegan* (please see note below), no PAO on palette (may have been on original box) 


🌟 Note: there are two versions of this palette floating around - the OG palette that launched in 2017, &amp; the newly made-over version that relaunched in 2020. There has been immense controversy &amp; dispute surrounding this relaunch, because the original palette was made with a vegan formula. 


Upon relaunch, the formula changed to one that was no longer vegan - yet both Morphe &amp; Jaclyn Hill have stated that the relaunched palette contains the EXACT same proprietary formula. The entire formula had, in fact, changed, including additional ingredients carmine, coconut oil, &amp; shea. 


The palette that I'm currently using for this review, is the 2017 OG vegan palette with the unchanged formula.

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️Patchiness: no patchiness 


🔸️Blendability: very easy to blend out 


🔸️Fallout: experienced slight fallout, the most being from matte shade 'Enchanted' 


🔸️Shade Variance: this palette has a nice 'light-to-dark' gradient. There are a few neutral transition shades for a range of skintones. This includes an excellent formula balance ratio. 


🔸️Formula: 


MATTES: these mattes were very pleasant to use. They effectively blended with every brush I tried, I got them to easily build &amp; layer, I didn't experience any unwanted patchiness. Each color was definitely pigmented, &amp; the color similarity was on point. I knew I could rely on getting the same shade on my eye as to what I was seeing in the pan. 


SATINS: there are only a few of these, but I really like them. The microglitters are far smaller in size when compared to one of the shimmer shades. Applied, these have a very smooth base, with a subtle illumination that enlivens the most drab areas. 


SHIMMERS: some of these shimmers are slight, whereas other ones are pretty foiled! They are more chunky in comparison to the satin shades, &amp; have larger micro particles in them. Each shimmer shade in this palette has a base pigment, so you can use these in a variety of ways. They apply very easily with a brush, which is important to me. 


MATTE BLACK: here is my customary comment on the included matte black - the most important of all shades in a palette. To make it simple - I like this one. It's not the best I've used, but it's pretty nice. Nothing bad to say about it!

......

🔸️Packaging: nice; it just reminds me of Jaclyn Hill, so I think they did a really great job of picking packaging that speaks well of the creator. 

......

🔸️Recommendation: I've used this palette here-and-there over the years, but I never really paid attention to if it was GOOD or not. Overall, I was amazed at how easy it was to use, I love the amount of shadows to select from, &amp; all the tones just go so well together. I really do enjoy this palette, &amp; have been very happy with the results. The price per shade is 'excellent' when compared to market price. Each shadow pan holds an above-average amount of shadow per pan. People may find difficulty in storing this palette, due to its extremely large size. I am keeping this in my collection. 


▪️If you are interested in this palette, I would definitely recommend it.

+ easy to blend

+ range of colors to select from

1635676291,Makeup,Foundation flaking off on my nose no matter what I do.,"I’ve always kept up with my skincare, I wash my face twice a day and moisturise as well as using serums here and there. My nose feels very smooth and hydrated, yet the second I apply foundation/concealer it instantly flakes. I’ve tried beauty blenders, brushes, my fingers, all to no avail. I’ve tried primers, I’ve tried powdering my face before application (saw this on tiktok), and nothing has ever worked! Even if i just put concealer on my nose, it flakes horribly on the tip of my nose and nowhere else. 
I’m not the best with makeup but I know my basics, but this is a problem I’ve struggled with since I began using makeup a year or two ago. I have a red nose/cheek area so I do like to cover it up from time to time, but the second I apply foundation it flakes instantly. 
Does anyone have any tips or personal holy grail products that could help me out??"

I recently started wearing makeup and I love doing it. I used to not wear it at all or I would just wear mascara (considering my lashes aren’t long people didn’t notice I was wearing any lol) 
I started wearing eye liner a lot and I got very good at it so I’m happy about that but I’m struggling with concealer/ foundation. When I do my makeup I only want to hide a few scars but my skin always ends up looking very greasy at the end of the day or even a few hours after I’ve done my makeup ( I don’t have oily skin bc I don’t have this issue when I don’t wear concealer or foundation) , would powder help with this issue ? Or anything else ? I also have trouble finding my exact shade my face is a little bit darker than the rest of my body.

Ps : I can’t do eyeshadow at all it’s so frustrating any tips on how to blend correctly?"

1635687775,Makeup,"I feel like there should be colour codes for every makeup product, or at least from well known brands.","Especially lip products. I mean, colour codes like when buying art supplies. You often get a pigmentation code, like py129. If a product has that colour code I know it will be a green/gold/yellowish colour.

 That way you get a better understanding of what the colour will look like, and if you're searching for a specific colour in a product with a certain formula, that gets easier too. 

Ofc colours will look differently depending on what kind of binding it is mixed with, but still. It would make things much easier imo. And, yes, it is very good that we can find reviews with swatches when ordering online. But still, it would be a dream if makeup companies did this.

Or are they already doing this and I've missed that? Please do tell me if that's the case 🙈"

1635697673,Makeup,Interested in completely overhauling makeup collection,"I use a “cc” cream from it cosmetics with a setting powder but I’m not in love with how it works with my combination skin- it looks great in the morning when I first put it on although a bit cakey in the powdered areas, but then it melts and looks oily rather quickly throughout the day. I have their under eye concealer also but I hate it - very thick and hard to apply so I pretty much just rely on the cc cream but it’s not the greatest coverage for dark circles. I was recently married and my makeup artist used Mac products and I liked the result. I know that like 95% of this was probably her technique, but now I’m left wondering if I should be using different products. I don’t mind a makeup overhaul at this point but am kind of clueless on where to start, especially since makeup counters near me are not applying makeup to customers right now due to covid.

The skin in that area is a bit hooded, so maybe that’s contributing to the issue?

1635725768,Makeup,Update: Weird Pointy Lipstick Applied to tiny human.,"
[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/qj69eq/how_to_apply_weird_pointy_shaped_lipstick_to_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

So, to bring everything to a close, just thought I would do a little update.

I ended up getting one of the elf concealer brushes to apply the lipstick. Ended up sort of dabbing it on the lipstick and brushing it on. It was a significantly better outcome than the first attempt. It was oddly similar to dry brush painting miniatures.

Additionally, based on the whims of a 5 year old, the tiny human decided she did not want the eye shadow. So literally the only thing she wanted to wear was the lipstick.

It lasted about 5 minutes into the evening, at which point it was largely removed by her eating a hershey bar. One of my friends was handing out full bars.

All in all, I guess we’ll count it as a win.

Thank you to everyone for the advice."

1635802172,Makeup,Male. Brothers wedding coming up. Want to contour my face whilst looking like I haven't got any makeup on,"Hi people ;) 

Wedding is in 3 weeks. I'm not in my best shape but I'm trying.

I want to contour my face, and I want it to stay on my face even when I sweat, or get really cold outside. It's an evening wedding. The YouTube tutorials I've seen have people put on a lot of concealer/foundation - I want to avoid these. 

From what I have gathered, this could be my plan of action:

1. Moisturizing cream - a LOT of it. 
2. Pore reducing primer on the cheek areas 
3. Powder contour thing - and make a Zoolander pose face, apply the contour thing on the hollows
4. Use a beauty blender and dab the hell out of it, but softly 
5. Dab gently with a makeup brush
6. Translucent setting powder (not translucent powder?)
7. Setting spray
8. Act cool.

What do you think? Is there anything I should do differently? 

I have put on concealer and foundation before on my face and personally for me it looks way too obvious for someone who's trying to look like they have nothing on. If I put concealer, sometimes especially if the weather gets colder (which it is now), it flakes too.

I‘m actually quite experienced with make up (or thought I was) but realized I don’t really know how to work with cream highlighter. My main problem is that I don’t know how to layer products and that my cheekbones are so close to my undereyes. So if I apply foundation and concealer followed by the highlighter it does not layer well and dissolves the product underneath. I’ve tried multiple ones. Same goes for applying after setting with powder, which is not a surprise. And it’s really difficult to set my undereyes without getting powder on my cheeks.

Let’s pretend for a second it would work to apply it on top: do I leave it as is? Do I set it with a powder (highlighter) and how do I apply powder blush without everything getting caught up in the highlighter? Do I need to use all cream? Is liquid highlighter just not for everyone?

I know I can't change my skin tone, but is there any sort of trick or product like a powder or something that can make me look a bit more pale or at least give that illusion?

i know a lot of people use blush to give their skin color but blush actually makes me look more pale lol, thats why I like using blush. I was just wondering if you guys knew of anything else I could do. I'm also going to stay more on top of sunscreen, my face is like darker than my chest lol cause I don't use enough sunscreen. But other than that, any tips?

Also this has nothing to do with race or something. I know there's a whole toxic thing about how women try to lighten their skin to be more like accepted in society in some cultures and stuff, thats not what this is about, it's just an aesthetic thing for me"

1636024664,Makeup,Looking for a cream blush and bronzer/contour? No idea where to start.,"My budget is fairly tight being a student. I’ve always struggled to find something that’s the right shade to contour with, most things are too orange or dark for my skin tone. My most fitting shade for my skin is Estée Lauder 1W0 Warm Porcelain. I have that pale redhead skin (thanks dad!) that has always been really hard to shop for.. I can’t afford Estée Lauder currently so lately I’ve been using L’Oréal infallible 24hr in the shade 400 Pearl. It’s a decent match for the most part. 

Anyways, since I use a liquid foundation I thought I might need to switch to a cream or liquid blush/contour. I’m currently using powder. The blush I’m using is a nice shade, Pink Prosecco (Ulta brand), but the contour I’m using is terrible. I’m using Maybelline City Bronzer in the shade 200. It’s too orange. I think I need something more muted, maybe lighter. 

Any suggestions?"

So I got into makeup in the last year of my senior year in 2019. I only would do mostly basic looks and would not practice much because I felt I looked bad compared to others. Then I didn't put on makeup for months since the pandemic began for many reasons, mainly it's hard to wear makeup with a mask on all the time. So recently I want to get back into makeup because it feels like I am wasting the products I bought if I don't use them. I would like advice on what can I improve and what makeup styles and colors would suit my face. I am not experienced much and I am kinda rusty in what I could do from not doing it for a while. Your advice is much appreciated!"
1636035659,Makeup,Why does lipstick always goes all weird on my lips??,"Every lipstick I've tried, at least 10-15 different brands, goes all funny on my lips. It's like the pigment settles in the creases on my lips and creates these super pigmented lines that show up so clearly compared to the rest of my lips. (I've tried to take photos but they don't come out clear enough). Even some lip glosses so it, the ones with a super thick formula. 

I keep hydrated, I regularly use lip balm and exfoliate. My lips feel plump and soft and the lines aren't even very noticeable until I put lipstick on.

I struggled with makeup for a long time since I have hooded eyes and my face likes to reject foundation but I've finally managed to find things that work for me and have a pretty good routine down, but no matter what I do, I just can't make lipsticks work!"

I'm assuming I must have gotten a metal allergy so I guess I'm looking for something hypoallergenic/metal free? Waterproof is important cause I work in heat, humidity, and rain. And I'll consider gel if y'all can't think of a pencil that'll work lol I just can't seem to find this exact combo on google. I just get lists of best eyeliners 2021 lol

I have been seeing more and more studies coming out about PFAs / forever chemicals and other irritants in a significant percentage of makeup products sold in the US. 

I learned today that US makeup companies test their own products, while in Europe all products are tested by a third party before hitting the market (Source: https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/warning-toxic-chemicals-found-makeup-even-high-end-brands-investigation-finds/VUVUBLLO45A3TDGWX5RAXT6HCI/).

👉 Lancôme - Teint Idole Ultra Wear 


First-Impression Review: I applied this foundation with a brush, &amp; I got completely full-coverage. It has a very lightweight, serum-like consistency. It doesn't feel like I'm wearing any makeup at all! It fully &amp; completely covered old acne scars, current red acne bumps, melasma, &amp; other hyperpigmentation. It has a very strong paint-like scent that quickly dissipates as soon as you apply it. This foundation gives a dewy finish, also was easily blendable. I really think this looks good!

👉 Illamasqua - Gel Sculpt Contouring Gel 


First-Impression Review: the absolute first thing I noticed about this is its STRONG artificial rose scent! I powered through it, as I've heard MAGICAL things about this product. The color looks very dark in the component, but it's actually quite sheer when applied. The color seems more warm-toned to me than what I prefer for a facial contour. It IS a complete gel formula, which is cooling upon application. It applied kind of dry, so I had some issues with it skipping. It also did not blend out as easily as I'd hoped. On a good note, it did NOT lift my base in the slightest. It's also a 'buildable' product, so the more pressure you apply, the darker the color you'll get. It's not as enchanting as I had hoped, but I can make it work. I would probably move forward using this as a bronzing product.

👉 Brow Bar by Reema - Brow Lights, Camera, Action! Duo Brow Highlighter Pencil 


First-Impression Review: I was super excited to try this, as I love multipurpose highlighting pencils like this. I always use them on both my brows &amp; my eyes as an everyday, staple product in my routine. It's just a very small step to take to look more 'alive' in the mornings, (&amp; if you are NOT a morning-person ... like me), then you'll love something like this! One side of the pencil is shimmery, &amp; the other side is matte. You can coordinate it in any which way that you choose, &amp; it just brightens up your face &amp; adds a little somethin'. Plus, the actual initiative to use a product like this (or implement one into your routine) isn't overwhelming at all. This is one of the best highlighting pencils that I've used. I love the duality, making it much more versatile.

👉 Bellapierre - HD Setting Spray 


First-Impression Review: this is a very expensive price for a bottle this tiny (that was my first thought). I applied it, &amp; OMG ... just NO. The sprayer mechanism on this is God-awful. What SHOULD be a fine mist cloud - separates itself into two high-pressure streams, completely disregarding your delicate makeup - &amp; soaking your entire face in a very, very bad way. Another con is its flowery botanical fragrance...yuck! I gave it a solid wear test, &amp; found that it's a very sticky spray that takes a long time to dry down. After FINALLY drying, it actually did work to prolong the wear of cosmetic products. However, this is just something I'm not going to EVER reach for.

👉 I Heart Revolution - Heart Breakers Eyeshadow Palette 


First-Impression Review: I caught this on super-sale, &amp; I only paid $1.50 for this entire palette. I truly LOVE a good blue eyeshadow, so I couldn't resist. I swatched each shade firstly, to see what I was working with - &amp; I must say that it swatched impressively!  The look I created was really fun to make, &amp; I didn't struggle at all trying to figure out 'what to put where'. It's a pretty easy palette to just casually apply. Each shade that I applied worked extremely well. I actually enjoyed the blend on these shadows! The color-story is respectably unique - being a primarily 'blue' palette, but providing shades of purple, green, &amp; gold - ALL in a 9-pan! There are two really special, intensely foiled shades in this palette, &amp; they performed spectacularly!

👉 Fenty Beauty - Gloss Bomb Cream 


First-Impression Review: one of the things I'm most self-conscious about is my heavily-lined lips. Due to this insecurity, I'm always looking for a product that is going to positively work to enhance my lips rather than show every line. THIS one actually fully fills in my lip lines, &amp; makes my lips look more pouty &amp; naturally full. Exactly the type of lip product I search for (personally). This particular gloss actually carries a pigment, providing subtle color to your lips (but not overwhelmingly so). I really like that once applied, it stays very shiny for quite some time - &amp; it doesn't feel sticky in the slightest. You can also pickup a very sweet scent in this gloss.

My eyelashes just get in the way, the pencils keep skipping over top of the hairs. It's hard to explain. Also, I get a shin ton of eyeliner build up on my lashes.

1632913377,Makeup,Looking for a dupe that doesn’t leave my eyes as bald as Dwayne Johnson!,"As above. I’ve been using the L’Oreal Unlimited mascara to gigantic results - super easy to apply, goes on quick, lashes look incredible. Wet formula that doesn’t take‍ much work. However, it’s a BITCH to get off, despite the fact that it’s not waterproof. My micellar water is just not cutting it, and I’m losing lashes at an alarming rate. No strict budget, just looking for something that works! Better than sex takes too much work (might just be a lack of chemistry), and the few supermarket brands I’ve bought since have been unbelievable mediocre. If I had to be picky, I’d say something a little less clumpy than the L’Oréal one would be ideal, but a formula close to that would be ace. Cheers! Ps. The rock is great.

1632930971,Makeup,Is…is Shimmer…Dead?,"This is hard for me to ask. Maybe cuz I’ve crossed the other side of my 30’s and own over 11,000 neutral palettes all purchased for that Pop of Bronze Foil Gold Shimmer. We’ve been at it since high school and we’re happily married and had several Shimmer babies. But like…should we get a divorce? 
It’s just that lately I’ve been looking more at Mattes (I know I know, outside of my marriage how disgusting). I’ve always thought Mattes were so boring! I needed that pep, that sparkle, that Oomph. I was young! Matte was always a reliable friend and everything, laying the base, contouring your peeps, blending your shit, helping you move. But at the end of the night, you know I be fucking with Shimmer. Get my brush WET, dig in deep, lay it on thick. We were happy.

But like, lately I’ve been hanging more and more with Skincare. And I like what it’s done for ME. I’m glowing more, my skin feels healthier. And now my vibe with Shimmer is all off. My Highlight doesn’t get me off as much and just makes me look sweaty. And my beloved Shimmer lid kinda looks like it’s trying too hard now. It doesn’t look dignified partying like that at our age, screaming for attention. 

But you know…the love is still there. I can’t deny it. We have so much Herstory together and I just…I dunno. 

Anyone else feel this way sometime? Anyway, thanks for listening…

1632932597,Makeup,Extreme self esteem problems,"I’m a teen in high school and around 3-4 years ago I ran into some issues with my weight. I thought that skipping meals would make people like me more since in middle school I was made fun of but not necessarily for my weight ever. I was very awkward and what most people would consider unattractive. So I began to drop weight like crazy and eventually my friends said they’d tell someone. Fast forward a year and I started to get into makeup, it started out very natural and light but it turned into a full face for school every single day. The guys and girls that made fun of me now paid extra attention to me. I was called beautiful by everyone even some of my siblings guy friends and soccer teammates. Problem is that I look disgusting without it and I have to wake up early every morning to put on this mask. And even after years my weight problem has never gone away, I throw out lunch at school to stay under a weight and I refuse breakfast. I get extreme guilt and panic when I go over a set number of cals. I cant tell my mom or an adult because my own mom even said I’m wearing too much makeup and asked what I’d do if these boys saw me without it. And when I tried opening up to her about my diet problem when it first started my phone was taken and that was that. Now I can go without social media I’m not like that but that’s how I’d talk to my friends who have my back. My mom cares but just don’t understand. I’m so obsessed with makeup and my weight and I know I’m unattractive without it. I don’t know what to do."

1632970406,Makeup,Should There Be Travel Sized Foundation?,"I’d like to hear what you guys have to say :)

For me, I think that companies should start creating smaller sizes of foundation because it’s something that is so unique to everyone, but there are too many options out there. How can someone find their “holy grail” or discover a brand that suits them better if they’re spending time finishing up their current full sized bottle.

Full sized foundations take a long time to get through, and bottles can expire before it’s all used up. This is especially true for those two alternate between different brands at once. There will never be enough time to finish it before it expires. Not to mention the bulkiness of bottles of liquid foundation that can be a struggle while traveling. 

Id rather try the mini sizes to test out everything in a foundation without having to be fully committed to spending $40 on a bottle of foundation that looked good as a swatch but not on my face. 

Sample sized packets usually only contain enough for one application, which isn’t enough to test out the long term effects of wear (if it contributes to acne, too drying ect.) 

We have travel sized everything from lip kits to eyeliner, it would be nice if mini sizes of foundation were offered as well. 

I can see how some people could say travel sized is wasteful packaging, but I find that having to toss out a half empty expired full-size wasteful as well. 

Also Im aware that expiration dates don’t always have to be followed, but after a few years of almost daily use, I think my foundation has to go no matter how full it is.  

So should there be a mini/ travel sized foundation in your opinion?"
1632972457,Makeup,Foundation mixer for a *slight* touch of luminosity?,"Hey folks! I'm looking for some suggestions on a foundation mixer.


As summer is winding down, my combo/oily skin is getting a bit less oily. At the beginning of summer I started using the Urban Decay Stay Naked foundation and I LOVE it. Perfect shade match, lasts as long as I need it to, stays looking fresh all day. But as my skin is getting closer to ""normal"" and less oily (which is typical for me in the fall/winter months) my foundation is starting to look a little dry. Not cakey, at least not yet, but dry. I am not at all in the mood to shop for another foundation lol so I'd rather mix something into it to tone down the matte finish a bit.



I tried the Glow Recipe dew drops and honestly it was exactly what I was after. Not sure if the magic is in the drops or the foundation, but I mixed equal amounts of both and didn't sacrifice coverage in any way, and the foundation was still matte but with just a *touch* of luminosity. Perfection. So of course my stupidly sensitive skin had a reaction to the dew drops. My cheeks got red and inflamed and got a mess of small red bumps everywhere. Just lovely!



Next I brought out an old tube of the Dr. Brandt luminizer primer and mixed that in with the foundation. It was nice enough, definitely toned down the dry appearance, but it didn't look as natural as the dew drops did. Neither does any of my moisturizers, and those also sheered the foundation a lot more.



Does anyone have any suggestions for a good mixer? Anything out there similar to the dew drops? I just really loved the touch of luminosity without having any shine, shimmer, or glitter. I'd prefer to stay from oils, I've had too many do me wrong in the past. But I'm open to just about anything else, primer, serum, moisturizer, etc. I'd prefer something I can get at Sephora since it's most convenient for me, but I'm not married to that idea.



Thanks in advance and sorry for the novel!"

1632980728,Makeup,My colors don’t work anymore!! (Choosing makeup in 30s),"I’m 32 and over the past several months I’ve been realizing with increasing awareness that my makeup colors that worked for me amazingly for the last 10 years don’t work at all anymore. They literally don’t match my skin anymore, look weird and clownish instead of bright and fresh and - I don’t get it. I know styles change but this isn’t that. The colors literally no longer compliment me.

Not only that, the foundation that worked just last year seems… oddly bright and unnatural to my eyes now. I think I’m still getting away with it but… I seriously don’t know what to do.

Are there any articles anyone knows of regarding changing shades in your 30s, what causes it (scientifically speaking, not just “age”), and how to figure out what colors will work?"

They were $11 each and I used $60 in rewards for them, so I thought I was getting an amazing deal. 

The colors are PERFECT. The formula is so soft and amazing. The packaging though… none of the liners retract!! I can’t roll them up to get more product or roll them down to protect the product. It’s crazy! I actually thought I was losing my mind. I brought one to the store and asked the sales rep if I was insane… she couldn’t get it either and ended up breaking the eyeliner. I read the reviews; apparently this is a common issue. I’m returning the rest and am so disappointed! 

What are your favorite eyeliners that are soft, smudgy, and easy to blend? I love smoked out liner looks and really like interesting colors. I won’t use them in my waterline so they don’t need to be waterproof or have amazing staying power. Something slim and retractable (not one you sharpen) would be ideal.

1633112339,Makeup,makeup tips for masculine faces,"Info: please excuse any spelling errors, I'm from europe lol

Hi all! 
I geniunely love wearing make up but these days I don't really have the time and patience to do a full glam everyday and I try to stick to a more natural look, since I work at an office. Problem is: I have very strong masculine features and people sometimes even confuse me for a guy, which is...not so great to hear, for me personally. Basically I look like my dad, but with longer hair. 🙃
Usually I put on a heavy eyeliner, to accentuate my eyes, but I really love the no makeup look with just a bit of brown eyeshadow used as eyeliner. I have a slight 5 o clock shadow on my upper lip (thanks dad for making me extra hairy), a huuuuge forehead and of course thin but very defined lips, which are impossible to overline without looking ridiculous. (I've tried, trust me)
I've been thinking about a forehead reduction and lip fillers, which would solve 99% of my problems but probably add up a lot of new ones and make me poor, considerind I'd have to touch up the latter every few months and risk to look like a duck, with all that bad migration I've been seeing. 

So are there any girls struggling with this as well? Do you guys have any tips for me? I'd prefer to wear less makeup, just doing a cute parisian ""no makeup"" makeup look, but I feel like that's not possible. 
Thanks for any tips in advance!!"

Are those UD duochromes really discontinued?? 
Is there still some place I can try and buy these online? Does this mean I'll have to grab it from my store while it can still be grabbed at all full (and jacked up euro tax) price be damned?

My question is though, for someone with a face between round/triangle, how would you contour onto pale makeup well? Do you use just a shade darker?

1. I don’t wear makeup daily, so a foundation based sunscreen is out
2. I have quite sensitive skin, and some sunscreens have caused reactions.
3. Another medication I take causes heat sensitivity, so I sweat a lot- especially on my face. This is made worse by heavy sunscreen that doesn’t let my skin breathe. That means Ive sweat off the sunscreens I have tried. 

I swear I’m genuinely trying to get help with this, my skin is a gremlin that is impossible to please. I don’t want skin cancer. However, I have to be firm on not wearing makeup daily, not because I don’t want to, but becuase it’s not permitted in some of the rooms in my work for safety reasons. In this particular chemical lab, our faces are supposed to be clear of anything that is not PPE. We also are a testing laboratory, so the rule is also to avoid contamination of any kind. Yes the rules are frequently bent (try to prove someone’s wearing mascara without grabbing their eye) but foundation is just not a feasible option for me each day. Any other suggestions welcome! Thank you all!!!"

1633345903,Makeup,Maybelline Matte Ink - what am I doing wrong?!,"So after reading a lot about this liquid lipstick and everyone and their mother falling over themselves to sing its praises and how it won't come off no matter what, I bit the bullet when it was on sale last week. 

It's very disappointing so far. After making a total mess the first few times I applied it, I finally got that part down but... Eating, drinking, kissing... It just comes right off, smudges all around my mouth, I leave stains on everything and everyone. It's terrible. I do use lots of lip balm but having read the instructions of this lipstick, I remove everything from my lips before application to make sure my lips are as dry a canvas as possible so the product can adhere to them. But no matter how much or little product I use, it stays sticky for quite a bit and never seems to fully dry. I blot and set with powder and don't do anything to my lips for hours after application but first time my lips touch anything, it'll be ruined immediately. 

Am I doing something wrong? Why doesn't it budge for everyone but me?!"

I've heard from others before that making my eyebrows black with eyeliner pencils and having a lighter shade of hair is unatural and distracts people from identifying me as male. 

Recently I bleached my hair because I thought that would help with my look. It did not. It really didn't. Well, I feel like it would work if I didn't have bangs from 1 year ago still. But I do, so I'm getting a ginger wig that doesn't have bangs and I wanted to use a ginger eyeliner pencil to draw on lighter eyebrows.

Today I noticed my Sunset ND palette had oily condensation on the plastic shade cover. It was over the eyeshadows Morgana, Mandarin and Bronzage, which are all metallic. I store my makeup in my room in a dry place. So why was the oil in the metallic shades seeping out? Have the particular shadows gone bad?  I kind of regret wiping the oily moisture away before I thought to take pictures. I’m ashamed to say I used the shades on my lids to test out if they preformed badly but they didn’t.

I get so many compliments. No other foundation can give me the same results. And it stays on me SO well. My only negative is the amount of dust the product produces when I buff it on. It gets in the air and on every surface in my bathroom (and my attached bedroom). I promise I clean regularly, but the amount of makeup colored dust on my bathroom cabinets, door frames, crevices in my bathroom, even on my ceiling fan in my bedroom.. it amazes me. It also scares me thinking I’m breathing this in as I do my makeup every day. I’m concerned that this is bad for my lungs. I have had worse sinus and allergy issues in the past few years.

Now I tend to rely mostly on nudes/browns/pinks and while I like it, and it’s pretty, I feel sort of…boring! I have some eyeshadow pallets with fun and bright colors, but it’s like I’m scared or nervous to use them. I worry I am going to look like a clown. It’s like I’ve forgotten how to do my own makeup. Especially within the last few years, since I became a mom and since the pandemic started. I don’t go out much, but when I do I rely on the same safe look. Plus, as I’ve gotten older, I feel like I have developed a bit of a hood over my eyes which has also changed the way I apply my makeup. 

I guess I’m wondering what some good resources are for tutorials specifically geared towards colorful makeup! Greens, blues, purples, you name it! I want to spice it up. I want to feel like myself again.

- use primer

- use powder to set

Pretty simple, but as I am prone to zits I never wanted to put too much product on my face. But this morning I gave it a try.

Bro, it is 3pm and my face is so fucking dry. And it's even been quite humid today. My skin is hydrated, but not slimy. Hallelujah!!!!

It doesn't have to be expensive either. I have cheap drugstore primer, powder and setting spray.

We will see if it makes me break out.

Method:

- let moisturiser soak in while I do my hair

- use a thumbnail of primer, rubbing and pressing it into my T-zone, eyelids and eyebrows

- concealer, brows, eyes and lips as normal

- finish with a swirl of powder across my whole face, then setting spray"

-nyx lift and snatch: dupe for glossier brow flick 

-l’oréal infallible foundation. little oxidization but there is some fragrance. buildabke coverage without looking cakey 

-beauty bakery face flour: comes in different undertones which i love because i’m slightly yellow so some setting powders can look ashy or pink on me. no scent like cody airspun 

-maybelline superstay matte lip crayon: not mask proof cause it doesn’t dry down, but i use it when i’m hanging out with my friends or at a family gathering. it’s very comfortable and lasts through eating food for the most part

-elf poreless putty primer: just get it already. 

-nyx born to glow concealer: blends like a dream and is not cakey and thick. buildable

-nyx sweet cheeks lip tint: a cream blush, lots of product and you don’t need much. blends super easily and lasts me the whole day

-butter bronzer: just get it. 

-wet and wild photo focus foundation stick: blends super easily unlike some stick foundations and looks like skin, i also use it for contour

-nyx brow glue: just get it. 

-nyx liquid lipsticks: just get it.

I just graduated with my bachelors degree Dec 2020, I am 27. I've wanted to go to cosmetology school since I was 19 but at that age my parents were helping me pay for school and I couldn't get Pell because they made too much and they refused to pay for cosmetology. By the time I was considered an independent, I was transferring to a 4 year college with a little less than 2 years to finish my degree. I finished, got my degree, and am now working a job where I make 43k a year. I applied to cos. school but I'm going to have to quit this good paying job because class starts at 4:30 and I don't get off until 5. Even if I were to figure it out where I could take a shorter lunch and leave at 4:30, I would work from 8-4:30, and then do class from 4:30 to 10:30 Monday through Friday and that sounds like setting myself up for failure with those long days for a year and a half. Advice for what I should do?"

As the title suggests, I am looking for tips on how to remove mascara without damaging my eyelashes. I wear mascara daily and right now I just use a cotton pad and some micellar water to remove it. Every night I remove my mascara, I at least rip out one or two eyelashes. I'm afraid that if I keep this going that my eyelashes will appear less full and that they'll just look bad.

I've tried different techniques, if I wipe it off gently then I feel like the mascara isn't properly cleaned off.

Thanks for your help."

1630497054,Makeup,Any skincare products to get rid of acne?,"Hello! I know that many of you have faced problems such as acne. Perhaps, some of you are still fighting with acne and post-acne scars despite no longer being teens. Maybe someone has already obtained a victory in this battle and can share some beauty tips. It would be interesting to find out which products you’ve tried already and can recommend to the rest?

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I cannot say that I have got rid of all the imperfections. I still do have blemishes from time to time. However, I found some products that can help me more or less.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If we talk about brands such as Clinique, Kiehl’s, and Garnier. I’m not gonna waste your time and talk about those brands. The only thing I would like to mention is that they are 100% effective, at least for me. Maybe you have noticed the same thing. That’s why I want to talk about the products you have tried already and saw some positive improvements in your skin? 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you can also suggest some masks, scrubs, or serums? For instance, my friend recently recommended me a watermelon sleeping glow mask. I’ve checked some reviews online, and it says that it also helps the prone to acne skin and even helps to get rid of post-acne scars. But, I’m the type of person who wants to double-check all the reviews and ask for more feedback about specific products before I buy them and put them on my face or body. Besides, I’m not a big fan of sleeping masks, but if it’s really gonna help me, I will put it all over my face.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I hope that this topic will be helpful for those who have acne problems at any age, and everyone can suggest some products and share their feedback."

I read a few post regarding tattoo/scar coverage topic, but some of the language is foreign to me because I’m a guy haha. What I understood is I need a concealer, setting power with talc in it, and a setting spray. 

Dermablend as a concealer; Ben Nye as the setting powder with talc; and Huda Beauty setting spray comes up a lot as recommended products.

I would want a calender that would just be makeup products and all high end and indie, I'm not rich so obviously full sized and palettes would be too expensive so it would be filled with travel size blushes, bronzers, highlighters, brow products, matte liquid lipsticks and single and duo eyeshadows, basically all makeup except for foundation and concealer really.

I have been doing my own makeup for years and have learned some tips but I cannot seem to fully cover them up. There always seems to be a gray cast underneath my concealer. I currently use the LA girl pro conceal color correctors in orange and yellow, the Bare Minerals bare pro concealer, and the Colourpop pretty fresh concealer. In the past I have used the Tarte creaseless concealer, the It Cosmetics bye bye under eye concealer, the Ardell photo face concealer, the ELF camo concealer, the LA Girl pro conceal high definition, and the BH studio pro concealer. I prefer a satin finish. I am also vegan so if you could recommend cruelty free products that would be great! Sorry for the long post!"

This week I got a bit of extra cash and decided to treat myself to a little haul of the lipstick and lip gloss from local beauty shops. (Just the shades I though might be a good everyday color. Didn't find it, btw but found other cute shades)

Three of the never-opened lipsticks I bought yesterday smelled like crayon and didn't have much color payoff. I figured it was because they were cheap. Later, I found out this means they're expired!

I washed my lips really well and put on some Carmex before I went to bed last night. This morning lips still felt dry and sensitive.

Is there anything else I should be doing in addition to or in place of using Carmex to heal my lips? I figured this wouldn't heal overnight, but I want to know the best thing to do and not just wing it and find that I did something else wrong.

Other than the crayon smells, are there other smells or things I should look out for before trying new makeup?

Thank you for your time."
1630936470,Makeup,No 7 foundation drops? something similar?,they don’t have my shade anymore and i’m so IN LOVEEE with this product. super high pigmented and lightweight. any suggestions for something similar?
1630940975,Makeup,Trifold Mirror with LED,Not looking for a brand recommendation really but more of a general opinion. Do you find them useful?

Does anybody have either style and can comment on how they like theirs please?
1630943324,Makeup,Physicians Formula the Healthy Foundation Dupe?,Hey everyone. I am just finishing up my last bottle of Physicians Formula the Healthy Foundation and I’m so bummed it’s been discontinued. Does anyone have any dupes? I’m willing to go high end if I need to as I love the finish and coverage level (slightly glowy and low medium coverage). Thanks!

So im looking for a place where I can get some good quality makeup, but for cheap.

1630952510,Makeup,Visible line between eyeliner and tightline (where lashes are),"Whenever I apply black eye pencil in the tightline/upper waterline and eyeliner above my lashline, I end up with this non-black line in between, in between my lashes. Even when I put on mascara, this line stays visible, and it's pretty out there. It bothers me, because it breaks up the look.

I've tried putting eyeliner in between my lashes, but it just doesn't work. My lashline is pretty wide, not all lashes are at the same height, if that makes sense, which makes it even more difficult.

Is there a way I can fix this problem? Is it the eyeliner itself (I have the Essence Tiny Tip Liner Waterproof), or would a gel liner with a brush be a better option? Or maybe a liquid one? 

If you think the eyeliner is the problem, could you also recommend a better alternative (I'm willing to try liquid, gel and pen)? I don't like eye pencil as eyeliner, because it tends to be wide and I have pretty hooded eyes. Thanks in advance!"

Additionally I recently got a new job where some of my coworkers are models, and everyone around me is incredibly beautiful. 

The problem is that any time I do something more than eyeliner and lip balm I feel super anxious that I look clownish. I practiced a little today, doing eye shadow, blush, etc and felt like I looked like a cartoon character. My husband liked it but he’s also literally color blind. I’m too afraid to go out with makeup because what if I look crazy?? I feel like I missed the age where you’re allowed to experiment with makeup and do too much. Are there any beginner friendly sites or youtubers y’all can recommend? How do I know if I actually look alright?"

👉 Maybelline - 'Fit Me Matte + Poreless' Foundation 


First-Impression Review: to apply this foundation, I used a beauty sponge. The first thing I'd like to mention is that I despise the method of dispensing the product - I end up pouring out way too much, &amp; it makes a mess! I did notice a slight fragrance to this as I was applying. After application, I wouldn't say that my skin looked 'matte' at all, it has more of a natural finish. I ended up achieving about a medium-coverage level, as my melasma &amp; blemishes were still visible (but everything looked more evened-out). I was also able to build this up quite a bit. After I let it dry for a little bit, it felt quite heavy on my skin.

......

👉 Covergirl - 'Simply Ageless Instant Wrinkle Blurring' Pressed Powder 


First-Impression Review: the first thing that I noticed upon application is the strong whitecast to this powder. It does not apply as a truly translucent shade. I tested it both under my eyes, as well as on my entire face. I ended up not really liking it as an undereye setting powder, as it settled into my finest lines &amp; creases too much. As a full-face setting powder, it really worked well to situate the products beneath &amp; mattify. I specifically noticed that it smoothed out my cheek texture really nicely.

👉 Essence Cosmetics - 'The Glowin' Golds Vitamin E Baked Luminous' Bronzer 


First-Impression Review: the plastic compact casing for this bronzer is extremely difficult to open (which I'd consider a barrier to use). Once I finally got it open, I swatched it to find the smoothness of a baked formula, combined with tiny micro-glitters. I was entranced by the application - it performs beautifully. It's not patchy at all, &amp; it doesn't skip. This bronzer is more pigmented &amp; warmer than other bronzers in my collection, so I was a little apprehensive of the outcome; &amp; surprised that it worked out so well! I applied it in a diffused method with a large, domed brush. 


➡️ Shade: 02 Good As Gold

👉 L.A. Girl - 'Shady Slim' Brow Pencil 


First-Impression Review: the protective exterior plastic wrap was an absolute NIGHTMARE to remove. The first task was the spoolie. I love the spoolie! It is comprised of an effective texture &amp; sizable length. As for the actual pencil side, the first bit I noticed is the the diameter of the product is really small, &amp; could be classified as a 'micro brow pencil'. Upon use, I didn't find anything revolutionary about it. The formula is actually pretty dry &amp; harsh, rendering pressure to be applied to get proper payoff. I'm not jumping-for-joy over it, but it's not the worst one I've ever tried. I think the specific color is really flattering on me &amp; closely matches my brow color.

👉 Maybelline - 'The City Mini' Palette 


First-Impression Review: just touching the shadows in the pan, each one was incredibly soft. As I began using the palette, I found the shadows to be significantly powdery, resulting in considerable kick-up in the pans &amp; fall-out on my face. I used every shade in this palette, &amp; found the mattes to be decently pigmented, but VERY difficult to get a uniform blend. I kept getting harsh lines that wouldn't budge. The shimmers, on-the-other-hand, are spectacular shadows. They are tinged with a base, &amp; they apply flawlessly. They pick up very well on a brush. This palette doesn't have an altogether 'best ever' formula, but it's workable - &amp; great as an edited palette to use when you want an unchallenging, quick eye look.

👉 Maybelline - 'COLORsensational Rebel Bloom' Lip Color 


First-Impression Review: I love the extensive shade range of Maybelline's bullet lipsticks - there's definitely a shade for everyone! These lipsticks do have a very distinct perfumed fragrance (&amp; even taste) to them, that I find some people may be appalled by. I really do favor the shape of the bullet - it's extra easy to get precise definition around lip line. This particular shade applied ... leaning more towards the 'sheer' side, which was unexpected. Overall, after looking at the completed resultant, I was satisfied &amp; can see myself wearing this often.

1631023251,Makeup,Oily face SOS,"So, I have revamped my make up and skin care routine recently. I have combination skin sometimes but always oily down the center of my face. 

1. I start off with a clean face and I put on some toner(Farmacy deep sweep). 2. Then I do a serum next(Claudalie vinopure). 
3. Moisturizer(Tatcha water cream oil free)
4. Primer(Fenty Beauty Pro flitr instant retouch)
5. Foundation (Dior forever matte)
6. Nars concealer if I need it under my eyes
7. Setting powder under my eyes and down the center of my face (Laura Mercier mini translucent powder)
8. Contour powder and blush
9. Setting spray

Can you tell me what I may be doing wrong? I’ve been watching a lot of Rober Welsh’s videos lately and he suggested only applying moisturizer where you need it. Like perhaps not down the middle of my face. Lol
I blot face through out the day but it just looks so greasy. Is there a powder you would recommend through out the day? Should I carry my translucent powder? Help me please! I live in a humid hot area too. 😂 fml

Side note; my evening skin care routine and on days I don’t wear make up is toner and then Bio oil. I have acne and scars and I like to use it to help my skin along. If it matters."

1631036740,Makeup,Makeup Brands like Charlotte Tilbury?,"Hey everyone, 

I'm looking for brands that have the similar quality/experience/vibe to CT. As much as I love her products, my experience with  customer service has been less than ideal on more than one occasion. I'm looking to support a brand that will still give me the same type of products (maybe a smaller company?) that is easily accessible in Canada. 

Here is what i really like about CT:

\-**Quality**: I know CT eyeshadows aren't the best in the market, but they're consistent and overall I enjoy the formula

\-**Easy**: While her releases are repetitive and overpriced, i find how she lays out her products fool-proof for somebody like me. I can pull out one of her quads and easily put a look together without thinking.

\-**Familiarity/Consistency:**  I know a lot of people would consider this a negative but I kind of like that all the shades are similar. The warm, pinky neutrals and even her ""colorful"" shades are extremely wearable (not too pigmented, easy to blend, same type of look)

\-**Packaging**: I'll admit that I'm a sucker for CT's whole esthetic and packaging. 

My favorite products from CT: flawless filter, airbrush foundation, compact blushes, matte revolution lipsticks + lipliners, airbrush powder (i also have the loose powder I enjoy) 

If anyone is familiar with CT products, please feel free to shoutout any products/brands below. much appreciated!"

1. The one where the price of the product is lower than in other shops, but you pay for shipping, OR
2. The one where the product is slightly more pricey but the store offers free shipping?"
1627663729,Makeup,Allergic reaction to a Tower 28 lip gloss ?,"I'd like to talk about something weird that happened today : I tried a Tower 28 lip gloss for the first time, and within seconds my lips felt numb, and I had a sensation of pins and needles, especially on my upper lip. 

The sensation went from ""wait, was this supposed to be plumping ?"" about a minute in, to not being able to talk properly, and needing to get this off my lips ASAP because it hurts, just 30ish secs later. After removing it, the numbness slowly faded, to be back to my normal sensations about 15mins later. I didn't see any swelling.

I'm confused because this type of reaction never happened to me before, I have no issues with my other lip glosses (at worst, I felt a slight tingling with the Fenty gloss bomb, and stopped using it). Plus the brand insists on their products being hypoallergenic, suited for sensitive skin, so I wasn't worried about allergens. I'm surprised at how intense my reaction was (and I'm on antihistamines, this is bizarre but I can't find another explanation than an allergy). I patch tested it on my had and in my elbow crease, nothing happened.

I looked up what could cause lip numbness but haven't found anything of note that could explain why the gloss did this. I compared Tower 28's formula composition to all the other glosses I've tried and had no issues with (Clarins, Roen, Pat McGrath, Lisa Eldridge, Too Faced, Urban Decay), and all I could identify as being different were the vegetal oils (apricot kernel oil, rice bran extract, rosemary leaf extract, rosa canina fruit oil, raspberry seed oil).

Has anyone had experienced a similar reaction, or have any insight on this ? I don't know what to think of this problem."

I do however wear a little bit here and there mostly foundation, lipstick, basic eyeliner, and mascara. 

My main issue is in foundation right now. I splurged a bit and bought NARS since it’s supposed to be good for dry skin and got it color matched at Ulta and everything but it’s too full coverage and ends up making me look fake and sickly since i don’t know how to contour or use blush. I started mixing it with a moisturizer to make it more sheer since it allows my natural red pigmentation to show and gives my face dimension but it starts like cracking and looking flakey despite being a liquid foundation. I use a primer and everything!

Should I try mixing it with something else or do I just need to cut my losses and try to find a new foundation with more buildable coverage? For reference the shade is mont blanc I have very dry skin except for my nose which is oily and I’m very red in the face.

Any help would be appreciated!!!"

......

This is a curated list (with reviews!) of my six most-loved, tried-and-true products from the month of July. 


Over the last month, I found myself repeatedly returning to these products, &amp; I wanted to share them with you!

......

📌 Touch in Sol 'Pretty Filter' Glassy Skin Balm 


▪️ Why: I ALWAYS double-prime, &amp; for my first primer I tend to go with either a hydrating or illuminating formula. This one is a SUPERIOR hydrator. It feels sooo nice as I apply it to my face, that I actually crave putting this product on. It feels the best hydrating the under-eye area, &amp; you can feel an immediate difference in the texture of your skin. There is a slight fragrance to this, but I really like it &amp; find it refreshing. The cream itself is very soft, &amp; almost gel-like in texture.


💰 Price: $32 (Ulta)

......

📌 Physician's Formula 'Butter Believe It!' Foundation + Concealer 


▪️ Why: I choose three foundations each month to use, &amp; NEVER would I have thought THIS would be the one that I liked so much! I love how it completely transforms my face &amp; covers up everything that I don't want to see - without feeling heavy or gross. Another benefit to this formula is that it doesn't BUDGE. It's very difficult to take off at the end of the day, which I kind of appreciate because it stays in place all day long. I love that it doubles as a concealer, so I get that demanded extra-coverage exactly where I need it. Also, this does have a strong tropical fragrance to it, but I don't mind it. It works extremely well with both a brush AND a dampened sponge. 


🕶 Shade: Light-to-Medium

💰 Price: $11.99 (Ulta)

......

📌 No7 'Lift &amp; Luminate Triple Action' Finishing Powder
 

▪️ Why: I ran out of my beloved Charlotte Tilbury mini powder, &amp; I've always heard that this was a dupe product for that finishing powder. Well, I even like it MORE than the Charlotte Tilbury! Just a fine layer of powder gently pressed under the eye creates an absolute blurred section. I was incredibly impressed the first time I used it, &amp; I couldn't believe the price difference! This finishing powder is an ABSOLUTE must-have in any makeup lover's collection. 


🕶 Shade: Light/Medium

💰 Price: $10.77 (Amazon)

......

📌 Charlotte Tilbury Brow Set - 'Brow Cheat' Micro Precision Brow Pencil &amp; 'Legendary Brows' Micro Precision Tinted Brow Gel 


▪️ Why: I just love everything about this duo. Together, these pieces create my perfect brow. The pencil is the PERFECT consistency, &amp; it's so easy to use as well as being comfortable in the hand. The shade is exactly what I look for in a brow pencil. I am able to create bold lines as well as simple strokes with the one unique tip. The brow gel, on-the-other-hand is the perfect set to my shape. The teensy brush allows me to get in between each brow hair &amp; shape them precisely where I want them. The color isn't overpowering, either. It's just enough to provide a slight ombre effect. If you are really into brows like me, you'd really enjoy this set! 


🕶 Shade: Pencil = Natural Brown; Gel = Soft Brown

💰 Price: Duo = $48; Pencil = $25 ; Gel = $23

......

📌 Lip Duo - Lottie London 'Slay All Day' Lipliner &amp; Tower28 'ShineOn' Lip Jelly 


▪️ Why: I always try new lip combinations every month, &amp; this was my find this month!! I love how this set creates the most-natural FULL, juicy lips - yet, it's so easy &amp; unchallenging. I use the pencil to line &amp; define only my cupid's bow area &amp; a small, bold line below my lower lip to create the illusion of fuller lips.

📌 Roma Laundry Detergent 


▪️ Why: I secretly enjoy doing laundry because I'm addicted to fragrant things - &amp; laundry is one of those areas where you can really discover some pretty interesting scents. I've always had my eye on this detergent, &amp; wondered how a $1 detergent would perform...&amp; well, it actually SHOCKED me. I am a dedicated powder-Tide person, &amp; I would choose this any day over powdered-Tide. It smells soooo good, &amp; cleans so well. I'm really happy I tested this hidden gem out. 


💰 Price: $1.12 (Walmart)

1627703936,Makeup,Lit from within natural highlighter - Sephora credit to use,"Hello. Can anyone recommend a lit from within, natural highlighter (no glitter/obvious shimmer) that would work on textured skin. I just want to keep it very subtle for personal preference. I’m going to have a $90+ dollar in store credit at Sephora to use because I forgot to return some items within 30 days. 

I’ve heard Nars may have something like this, but I find their blushes like orgasm to have too much glow. Not sure where to even begin. Alternately I’d be willing to try something drugstore just to dry out the look and use my credit on some dermalogica product or a few blurring powders I’ve been wanting to try. 

PS. Please no Hourglass. Their baked and ambient powders have emphasized my pores in the past and I’m not willing to try their brand anymore in general. 

Thanks!!"

Probably not a surprise but I'm a still-figuring-it-out-gender-wise AMAB who has been feuding with my beard shadow, and I feel like I could use some help from people who know what they are talking about. My beard is dark, rough, and pervasive, and I have extremely oily skin. I've tried a number of things, but I feel like I'm still at auto-clocked status even to myself which makes me \*super\* dysphoric. I'm also a total newbie to makeup for the most part and am kind of having to learn it out as I go.

My current routine: 

* Shave
* Moisturizer
* Face primer (Rimmel Stay Matte)
* Corrector over mustache/goatee area (LA Girl Peach Corrector), set with powder
* Concealer (Maybelline Fit Me) over the corrected area, set with powder
* Foundation (Maybelline Fit Me Matte + Poreless) over face, including corrected/concealed area

Am I going wrong on technique? Do I need different products for my face? How much of this is in my head vs . . .well, my face? 

I've put a few pictures into an Imgur album (multiple days, angles, lighting) for your consideration: [https://theprincessunknown.imgur.com/all](https://theprincessunknown.imgur.com/all).

            greens. Has the one perfect yellow. Such a fan of neutral tone
            nudes in the palette as well. The shimmers looks as amazing as 
            the mattes. Love the theme as I am hispanic. It's like the perfect

1627842553,Makeup,Makeup for smaller looking eyes,Is there a technique to make bulging large eyes look normal?
1627843626,Makeup,I'm a fifteen year old girl and I need help with my foundation.,"I've been using makeup for about a year now and thanks to face masks, I've had a little bit of room for expirementation but with the new school year coming up and the possibility of no masks, I find myself stuck in a corner.

No matter what i do, my foundation doesn't cover up my blemishes. I tried both powder and liquid, brush and fingers. I am currently using a medium to full coverage liquid foundation that is mostly working. The problem is that as soon as I step out of my bathroom and into the sunlight, it's almost as if my foundation isn't there. The sun shows the truth: that my foundation is not working. My pimples, which aren't terrible but still prominent, show, along with my freckles, which I'm not to worried about, dark spots on my face, and my huge pores. Of course concealer helps but there is only so much that it can do. I've tried going super light (maybe it just didn't look natural with too much makeup) and I've tried putting on multiple layers. My skin is often oily so I use a mattifying primer. It is silicon based while my foundation is water based so I tried using a different primer but I get the same thing. No matter what I do, when I look at my mirror near my window, it's just terrible.

My skin isn't the best, although I've recently begun taking bigger steps to fix that. I moisturize, exfoliate, etc, but I am a teen and I don't have the ""perfect skin"" gene. The fact is that I've seen the way that foundation can cover up imperfections and I can't figure out how to do it for myself.

Is it just that the foundation isn't right for my skin? Or is there a different application that I haven't tried? Thanks for reading and I hope that someone can help."

I was super excited cause this is the first colorful palette I've ever bought (I usually stick to rosey tones or neutral tones for eyeshadow). I did the patch test on my arm (I have a very pale skin tone so usually any shade types will show up on me pretty well), and I could barely see any of the colors at all. They also faded away within like 20 mins of being on my arm without any activity happening.

Is there anything I can do to make the pigment better without applying so many layers my skin gets irritated? I have 3 other Colourpop palettes that I've had little to no issue with. I know some of their colors aren't pigmented sometimes, but its never been an entire palette of 9 so this kinda sucks and I was super excited to use it ://"

1627868875,Makeup,Mascara keeps leaving black smudges underneath eyes,"Hello! I need some advice on what to do with my mascara. At the end of the day when I want to wash my face after the day is up I'll notice black smudges almost underneath my eye. It almost looks like a black eye or something or like I had put black shadow under my eye. I don't normally rub my eyes, so I figured it was caused by my mascara being on my lower lash line. 

Today I didnt put any mascara on my lower lash line and still ended up with the smudges. It's basically on the portion where I'd put my concealer on my eye bags, so if I try and wipe it off I just would end up removing my concealer.

Has anyone had this happen before? It's obviously not caused by the lower lash line now so I'm kinda lost on how to fix this. Am I blinking too much or something??

For reference, I use the Benefit Roller Lash mascara. Any advice would be helpful!! Thank you!"

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago I had an eyelash lift, so I'm looking to take better care of my lashes since the lift has dried them out a bit.

I'm looking for an alcohol-free, fluffy-effect mascara (I hate when lashes look ""crunchy"").

It is important that it is not waterproof and that it is easily removed.

I hope you have some recommendations for me!  


Thank you."
1627901659,Makeup,please help with my foundation 😭,"
hi 💖 i’m just looking for some advice &amp; tips on foundation products &amp; application. i get pretty mild-moderate acne but have fairly bad acne scarring so full coverage is a must i also have oily skin and all foundations i use seem to always separate (the worst is probably on my nose and my cheeks). 

i avoid doing any skin care or moisturising before applying the foundation because it has seemed to make it worse and instead just wash my face with water 

i’m currently using the Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt'R Mattifying Primer, Too Faced Born This Way foundation and the Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder

What am I doing wrong 😩 
also what is the best setting spray? I use just a morphe x jeffree star one and not really fan of that at all

thank you!"

For reference, my skin isn’t particularly oily or dry, and I don’t have a ton of acne but I do get it around my hairline and on my forehead some. There aren’t any other factors affecting my skin right now either- I love makeup but I don’t wear it everyday and it’s never made my skin worse. I also don’t really have a skincare routine and I’m not on birth control either so this is pretty much my skins natural state. I also have sensitive skin and have had reactions to certain sunscreens and on one notable occasion, chapstick. 

Any advice is welcome, thanks!!"

1627921044,Makeup,Starting Makeup at 27 [Makeup Help],"Hey everyone,  
I'm just now learning how to wear makeup at 27. Growing up I was never into makeup- I wore it to prom, to graduation, to job interviews, but literally that was it. It was both just a hassle and I was definitely one of ""those girls"" who thought makeup was ""hiding your true self"" or some other backwards thinking.   
Now I want to catch up and explore what I've been missing out on. From normal people on the street to you-tubers, makeup just seems so magical and really seems to elevate people's self esteem and mood.   
But I'm not 13 anymore and I don't really have the social permission to mess up my makeup and play around. If I come to work looking like a 6 year old loose in mom's lipstick, it hits a lot harder at this age.   


I took a minute to research and find out I'm a pink/blue undertone (different people call it different things?) and what colors work well with that as an introductory.  


I figured a BB cream or sheer foundation/sunscreen combo would be best for me to start with, so I got a bottle of Loreal's Infallible foundation in Cool Porcelain. I also grabbed a Burts Bees brown mascara and I already had a bottle of Lush's brown liquid eyeliner that I really like.   


I got in front of my bathroom mirror and tried my best. I feel like I look like Leatherface. Especially without my glasses, my face in the mirror looks alien. Inhuman. My partner says I look fine. Is this something I'll get over? Is looking at yourself in makeup and seeing YOU a skill you have to build? Or am I just doing something wrong? I don't think I'm putting on too much, but maybe not having blush is doing it?  


I appreciate any and all advice, and thank you for reading!"

It's kind of like the issue I've had with brush pens and drawing, and with those when I wear out the tip I just buy a new one. Should I do the same here? It's kind of an expensive liner, but I only ever use it for wings and it still has lots of pigment left. are there any good (cheaper) alternatives that are good for wings in the meantime until Ulta has another sale?

I went to a makeup trial last week (I'm getting married in a few weeks) and had false lashes put on for the first time ever. My eyes teared up nonstop but I eventually got used to it. 

The problem then was that they started coming off near my inner half of the eyes after an hour or two. My MUA blamed my glasses for them and said they would just come off like that because I was wearing glasses??? I don't know how this is possible but I wanted your advice on whether I should still give them a shot but have her put separate sections or just press them down whenever they come off throughout the wedding day."

✴ TOP 5 Favorites - Lip Gloss

......

➡️ NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding product quality. As always, use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun.

......

I'm sure it comes as no surprise, but I'm a makeup collector. I collect makeup products of all sorts! 


For this series, I really want to hone in on the products in my collection (by category) that have truly stood out to me, &amp; ones that I keep returning to over-and-over again. 


For this first installment, I thought it would be fun to start with lip gloss. Lip gloss is something that I use every single day - regardless if I'm wearing makeup or not. 


For me, there are certain attributes of a lip gloss which can define it as 'good' or 'bad' -  


I have heavily lined lips, so I need a gloss to automatically 'juice' up my lips &amp; camouflage those lines! The scent is another factor; I prefer a sweetly scented gloss. Lastly, I look for glosses that provide a sheer wash of color with a slight glimmer to them in order to reflect light. 


Please read on below to check-out my TOP 5 most-favorite (in order from least to greatest) lip glosses in my entire collection &amp; why: 

......

▪️Lip Gloss #5 - Bobbi Brown - 'Crushed Oil-Infused' Gloss

+ Color Description: sheer brown

+ Applicator: small paddle

+ Shade: 'Free Spirit'

+ Scent: oranges

+ Price: $29 (Ulta)

+ Comments: I just love how this gloss pairs with any lip liner. It is also so incredibly cushiony &amp; comfortable on the lips.

......

▪️Lip Gloss #4 - Milani Cosmetics - 'Keep it Full' Nourishing Lip Plumper

+ Color Description: sheer pink w/ gold shimmer

+ Applicator: large doefoot

+ Shade: '04 Luminoso'

+ Scent: peppermint

+ Price: $9 (Ulta)

+ Comments: this does not feel like a plumping gloss at all - it's very mild. I use this so much that I'm almost out of this tube &amp; really need to pick up another replacement!

......

▪️Lip Gloss #3 - Fenty Beauty - 'Gloss Bomb' Universal Lip Luminizer

+ Color Description: sheer pink w/ shimmer

+ Applicator: large doefoot 

+ Shade: 'Fu$$y'

+ Scent: fruit punch kool-aid packet

+ Price: $19 (Sephora)

+ Comments: I don't wear this a whole lot, because it's expensive &amp; I save it for best. When I'm going on a date, or going to a party, this is what I reach for. I love it ESPECIALLY because of its unique scent, it smells great!

......

▪️Lip Gloss #2 - Gigi Gorgeous Cosmetics - 'Less is More' Lip Gloss

+ Color Description: sheer pink w/ silver shimmer

+ Applicator: large doefoot

+ Shade: 'Get Into It'

+ Scent: cupcakes

+ Price: $4 (Amazon)

+ Comments: Oddly, this is one of my favorites! I bought it resale because I've always loved Gigi &amp; wanted to try her makeup. This certainly did not disappoint. 

......

▪️Lip Gloss #1 - ShopMisu - 'IXIA' Lip Gloss

+ Color Description: sheer red tint w/ multicolored glitter particles

+ Applicator: large doefoot 

+ Shade: 'IXIA'

+ Scent: cinnamon bubblegum

+ Price: ? (they are bringing it back soon)

+ Comments: my absolute favorite! I love how this catches the light &amp; makes my lips look so good! It pairs well with any liner, &amp; is perfect when your lips are dry.

I suffer from what is known as seasonal allergies, unfortunately the allergens that I react to include things that are in the air all year long, so I suffer all year long.

I'm allergic to dust mites, mold (both indoor and outdoor types), several grasses, several weeds, oak trees, pine trees, and cedar trees.

As you can see it's quite a bit, I was allergic to about 75% of the environmental allergens they tested me for. Since I'm allergic to so much, I now have to administer immunotherapy allergy injections to myself every week.

I'm not sure what it is in some eyeliners that cause my eyes to water and my nose to run like they do, but I really like to wear eye makeup because thanks to the allergies I also have massive dark circles under my eyes that I try to cover up, or I would like to try to use it to my advantage with some mild smoky eyes to add mystery.

But I only ever used one waterproof eyeliner that didn't make my eyes water and my nose run, it was by Almay but it's been discontinued.

I read online that any waterproof eyeliner is likely to cause an allergic reaction because of the oil base that makes it waterproof. 

But I was hoping surely someone out there has had experience, or used, or knows of some waterproof eyeliner that I can put on my waterline that won't cause my nose to run like a dripping faucet, or my eyes to water so profusely.

Help me, please?"

1628096005,Makeup,Suggestions for medium/buildable coverage foundation that won't stick to beard...,"Hi!

I had rosacea really bad as a kid and in my early 20's started wearing foundation to help mask some of the redness.  The rosacea is much more under control and rarely flares up, but I still wear foundation to even out my face.  (I'm 38 now)

I used to use Revlon Colorstay liquid, but looked for something lighter/more natural and ended up with Physicians formula CC cream.  I really like it - it provides enough sheer coverage that if needed i could use some colorstay powder over.  


I always wear ""shortish stubble"" (usually a number 3 on my beard trimmer) on my face and neck.  Now that i'm getting older, the hair on my face is getting lighter and or white in spots.  So now, these liquid makeups are really sticking to it and you can really notice it - it doesn't look so great anymore.  My whole goal is just inconspicous.  

I read online that maybe mineral foundations would be good - and not stick to the beard as much.

Does anyone have this issue and found something that works or can reccommend some products?

Thanks!"

Yesterday I had my first failed lash lift. Zero curl, zero lift. I've attached photos of before and after. The beautician is one I absolutely love and have been going there for years now, I know she's good, she didn't do anything different.

The only two things that were different this time and the reason I'm posting this is to bring awareness and maybe help make more informed Decision:

1. My period is just about to start, hormones sometimes play a role, although I've had it close to a period before and they lifted more than that.

2. It's been 5 days since my second Covid vaccine. We think this is the reason why my body completely rejected the lift and there were no results. If you have a lash lift booked, make sure it's been at least 14 days since any vaccine to potentially avoid a result like mine and a 6 week wait to get it done again.

But yes, hope this helps. Bit of a bummer as I'm leaving on a holiday in 2 days and was looking forward to not having to wear mascara for the whole trip, but I should have thought it through beforehand and had the lift a week or two ago.

1628166829,Makeup,Acne-friendly Make-up and how to use it?,"Hi!

I am a bit of a beginner, when it comes to make-up. I don't really know how to do much, I can put on mascara and that is kinda it. However, currently I use nothing at all.   
I get my brows and lashes coloured once a month, that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

But I want to get a bit more into make-up. The reason I stopped using mascara was because my current one would make my acne go crazy. It made me kinda sad to stop, because I loved the extra length that it gave me. I have considered maybe just getting fake lashes if there isn't a ""friendly brand""

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I would like to learn how to put on things like eyeliner, lipstick and eyeshadow.  I literally know nothing, not what colour that fits me, not what brand is good so and so on. I only know I like really deep red lipsticks, but I always feel weird wearing it.

It is not that I wouldn't also like to learn how to apply blushes or powders or whatever it is called. I am just so scared of freaking out my skin.

For things like price range, Idk. If there is some good cheap-ish options, I would like that.

&amp;#x200B;

If a picture of me would help, I can do that. I'm just a little worried about showing my face. But I am blonde with ice-blue eyes, my skin is pretty pale. I am very square-faced, I have been told my cheekbones are very defined."

I really like the look of contouring and have been watching YouTube videos online to get more of an idea of how to do it.

I put on a moisturizer (drunk elephant protini  polypeptide moisturizer) 
Then I follow it up with Lancôme blur and go primer. After I use makeup forever ultra hd foundation… a little blush and urban decay all nighter setting spray.

Maybe a silly question but, can you contour without adding other products for highlighting? I really like the look of Fenty match stix… any thoughts on those?

1628211225,Makeup,Too Faced Peaches and Cream Collection,"Does anyone know if this line is actually being discontinued? A little over a month ago I saw on Instagram it was being discontinued and products were 60% off. The line is my holy grail so I bought 3 setting powders and 1 foundation. My friend tried to do the same but the powders disappeared from her cart when she wanted to check out and the foundation colors were very limited. 

Sephora had very few foundation colors and eventually discounted the products and then returned to normal prices. 

Now on the Too Faced website almost all prices are back to normal and looks like they have the entire shade range of foundations. 

I don’t want it to discontinue but I’m so confused on what’s going on with the line!"

1628222530,Makeup,Does anyone else feel guilty actually using more expensive makeup?,"I don't have a lot of money at all, and buy most of my makeup at Dollar Tree (true story)

A few years ago, I bought an $11 foundation that I felt guilty even using because (for me) it was expensive.  

A few weeks ago, I had an appointment several miles away, and found myself near an Ulta.  I had never been in one before, and I remembered my grandmother telling me that she needed a hair product from there, so I decided to pick it up for her.  Well, I pretty much fell in love with it right away.  It was like a makeup wonderland.  I started looking at everything, and saw an eyeshadow palette that was absolutely beautiful.  The shadows felt amazing from the tester.  I had to have it, but it was $45.  I bought it anyway, but have yet to use it because I don't want to ruin it.  I know that it was a waste of money if I'm never going to use it.  Does this happen to anyone else?  How do you get over it?"
1628222782,Makeup,Which mascara should I choose?,"Looking to get a good mascara at Ulta during the 3x points special, so there are a few brands to choose from. I think it’s between Lancôme monsieur big, and Too Faced better than sex. Benefit Magnet mascara is another option.

I prefer a mascara that doesn’t single out every individual lash. I like a “dolly” look and will stick my lashes together on purpose with tweezers, to create the thick spiky look. Looking for volume for sure."

👉 Black Radiance - 'True Complexion HD' Primer 


First-Impression Review: the first thing I noticed about this is that it is HEAVILY scented like SPF. This primer is tinted - &amp; it actually gives you light coverage, so it acts almost as a BB cream. After wearing it for a few minutes, it heavily oxidized on my skin. It has a nice glowing finish. I really liked how it lightly filled in my pores &amp; smoothed out my cheek texture. 


➡️ Shade: 8927 Natural Nude

💰 Price: $5.99 (Amazon)

🚦 Rating: B

......

👉 Wet n Wild - 'MegaLast Incognito' All-Day Full-Coverage Concealer 


First-Impression Review: this concealer has a super nice creamy consistency. It did provide me with full-coverage. After applying, it looked rather smooth on my undereye, moreso than other concealers! After wearing it for a little while, I didn't find it to aggressively crease like other concealers I've tried. Be forewarned - this concealer sports a VERY heavy perfume-like fragrance. 


➡️ Shade: Light Beige

💰 Price: $4.99 (Wet n Wild)

🚦 Rating: A

......

👉 Lottie London - 'Ready Set! Go' Setting Powder 


First-Impression Review: I was getting aggravated with this packaging, as there are not enough holes to easily dispense the powder. It takes forever to muster up a small, useable pile. This powder has no fragrance to it. Upon using it, it greatly lightened up my complexion with its white cast. I was definitely not a fan of the way it emphasized texture both under my eyes &amp; on my cheeks. 


➡️ Shade: True Transluscent

💰 Price: $3.22 (sample) • F/S = $9.68 (Lottie London) [current conversion rate]

🚦 Rating: D

......

👉 Realher - 'Definer' Brow Pencil 


First-Impression Review: this is one of the nicer brow pencils I've come across. It has a really tiny precision tip, making it extremely easy to get the marks exactly where you want them. I found this to be just the right consistency for staying-power: creamy enough to use, but not overly-creamy where it's going to slip-and-slide all over your face. The color was a great match, &amp; I did enjoy the pigmentation. The attached spoolie is very useful, &amp; worked well. 


➡️ Shade: Eye Am Grateful

💰 Price: $16.00 (Realher)

🚦 Rating: A

......

👉 Revlon - 'So Fierce!' Prismatic Palette 


First-Impression Review: upon first touching these shadows, they felt very smooth &amp; creamy in their pans. This is a 'baked gelee' formula, &amp; it was my first time ever trying this type of formula out. I did end up getting slight fall-out. I think that the arrangement of these shades makes a really cute go-to eye look for every day, or this palette is perfect for slight washes of color. I really enjoyed using this. 


➡️ Style: 963 Slight Flex

💰 Price: $10.99 (Ulta)

🚦 Rating: A

......

👉 KAB Cosmetics - Lip Kit 


First-Impression Review: this lip kit comes with both a sharpenable lip pencil as well as an opaquely-colored gloss. Both of the colors match each other. The gloss has a large doefoot applicator &amp; a soft vanilla fragrance. I didn't find it to be sticky at all. When I wore this kit, I got a very 'vinyl'-looking finish. It felt awfully heavy on my lips, &amp; I couldn't wait to wipe it off. I think this product is great for short-term wear, like for photography. It also got all over my teeth. 


➡️ Shade: Charming

💰 Price: $30.00 (KAB Cosmetics)

1628229090,Makeup,How to apply eyeshadow if you can't wink?,"I can't wink - no matter how hard I've tried I cannot wilfully close one eye while leaving the other open. I've tried to hold one one eyelid, but that often causes smudges or just gets very finicky. To make it worse, I need to wear glasses and don't often wear contacts (they be expensive). 

So to my fellow non-winkers, how do you put on eyeshadow?"
1628232722,Makeup,My Skin Turns Red With Basically Every Movement,"Just to preface this - I am a dude.

For my entire life, my face has always been very sensitive. And because of this it gets red extremely easy. If I smile for more than two seconds, my face goes blood red and it will literally will stay red for like another minute after that. If I laugh its even worse. If I yawn or try to make my face even just slightly expressive, my face goes red. I've always hated this redness. Whenever I laugh when others are around , people immediately point out my redness and state I'm blushing because I'm embarrassed or something to that extent (which I'm not). And I know that they're not being rude or anything because I've looked in the mirror when laughing - my face goes so red its impossible to not notice and point it out. And it doesn't even need to be a big hearty laugh - even just a small chuckle will usually turn my face into a tomato (as a smile will).

I feel like I'm repeating myself a lot, but basically, my face turns red at basically every single movement expect talking. Because of this, I've always tried to stop smiling and laughing when I'm in public, and I've also always tried to keep my face movements to a minimum. The thing is - I hate doing this, and obviously, this doesn't always work and there are still a lot of times when my face turns bright red when I'm with other people because of my sensitive skin (not to mention this means I have to act pretty emotionless and monotone which isn't exactly a fun personality to hang around). I've tried makeup in the past, but the one's I've tried have always been too thin to cover the redness, or too thick that it's clearly visible I'm wearing loads of makeup (and not in an attractive way). Are there any products that could cover my red face and still be more discrete (i.e. so that someone I'm talking to wouldn't notice I'm wearing makeup). I'm specifically looking for products that can cover more than just mild redness like acne, but real like traffic light redness lol.  


Thanks!"

It seems it's been discontinued though so I'm looking for a dupe that would preferably not break the bank but also be blendable and long lasting. 

I've seen the shades compared to Urban Decay's Naked 3 palette and looking it pictures, that seems to be correct. SO searching for dupes of that I came across the Makeup Revolution Iconic 3. However, this one is very cheap and I don't know what to expect in terms of quality from it.

Thank you!!!"
1628279683,Makeup,What is my eyelid shape called?,"I'll try to explain as best I can.  My eyelids have a crease in them that runs roughly parallel to my lashes and nearly connects to the outer corner of my eye.  However this crease does not go away when I close my eyes, only when I lift my brows while my eyes are closed does it go away.  The crease also sits pretty close to my lash line, I can just about fit eyeliner between it and my lashes when my eyes are open, when closed there's a tiny gap between the liner and my crwase.  This makes most advice I find for eye makeup difficult as the crease makes eyeshadows nearly invisible.

I've looked at Asian eyes which seem to most resemble my eyes (my eyes are also really narrow though I'm white?) and that's closer, but their crease behaves differently with closed eyes from mine so that wasn't helpful either.

In fact I can't find an example of my eyes anywhere, not that it's saying much, I don't know much about this stuff.

No make up or plucked brows here.

I get a lot of redness on my face at times &amp; that is what is like to even out, and I got glasses so want my eyes to pop a bit.

Since the pic I've plucked and gotten my eyebrows under control. Using a brunette liner as my brows themselves are dark, and shaping with a brow gel.

I broke down and ordered Il makiage Woke Up like this, and the color match is surprisingly perfect... (I'm, well it's the color of the lightest part of my face...)

 I'm just on day 1 of it.

*Is it best to use a brush or one of those blender eggs dampened and squeezed of water and pressed into skin?*

**I want a liquid smudge proof upper lid liner (I think) but I don't know what color to get (or brand)**. 🙏

I'd like to do something about the dark circles under my eyes, but I think a lot is just shadows from bags. When I look up, the skin color is mostly the same with a few spots.
Is concealer just not going to do anything? I've tried everything for bags.

**what would be a good lip color for me?**

Should I just stick to a clear balsm?  
A (idk?)
My lips have lost collagen with age, so I don't want to line them or anything, or make them prominent.

I have a very light pink cool tone blush by MAC and a very light bronzer at my disposal.

I also have Blinc dark brown mascara (this stuff is amazing. No flakes. It tubes your lashes).

I also have vanilla sugar Bare minerals eyeshadow which just adds a hint if brightness.

After quite some time of browsing online and in person I came to a conclusion that makeup companies just despise the color red when it comes to eye-shadows. What I mean is that you always get an off-red like with a tinge of orange or pink, or darker, wine-toned red, or something else entirely.  

All **I** want is **red**. Like the RED that shows up when you go all the way to R on the RGB spectrum, like Canadian maple leaf red, a pure, beautiful red.

PLUS sometimes I just like to wear nothing at all on my face but my neck and chest are still significantly more pale than the rest of me.

I'm very fair and in the summer I always with I had just a little bit of a glow. The problem is that I have a lot of scars and stretch marks on my legs, and if I get a tan or use fake tanner, they look even more obvious. I'm wondering if there is a way to get a subtle sun-kissed glow (I know I'm never going to get a deep tan) without using self-tanner? I've tried Dermablend and tarte leg makeup to try to get some color and cover the spots I don't like, but it looks dull and fake and like I put makeup all over my legs. Jergens used to have this body bb cream and I kind of liked that but I can't find it anymore. Any suggestions?"

1625264151,Makeup,Best powder brush for sheer foundations? (Mac MSF Natural),"I do tinted primer then MSF natural overtop as daily driver, works with my texture and holds up all day. Using a beaten up old (honestly surprisingly good) Elf precision powder brush (big, lightly domed).

Only thing I'd like to improve is the overall finish. With the sheer MSF I like  softer, poofier brushes, I press/mop/brush then buff a little, but have to watch pores on nose, and floof seems to work better than something denser and flat (say Sigma F80)

Not heard great thing about MAC's new synthetics and wish I'd splurged on something like a 134 back in the day.

Any suggestions in reasonable, around $50 price range? Ideally available in Canada? Heard good stuff about the IT #1 or #8, heard hourglass is supposed to be fantastic but a little more than I want to spend. Ditto the old Sephora platinum pro was supposed to be good but is the new 'pro powder brush' any good?

Sorry to kick off another brush debate, but if anybody's got a brush that really makes the MSF natural shine, then I'd love to know. Thx!"

I have both ulta and sephora fairly close to me, as well as Macy's, Nordstrom and I belive even Saks.

I also did a bit of searching and the only recommendation I could find was for a Neutrogena product that was somewhat similar. I also have rose hip oil and squalene from the ordinary but they don't give that same glow that future dew does. 

I have super dry, non breakout prone skin,  so something that is on the oiler or shiny side is totally fine.

I tend to go for colourful eyeshadows, if I wear liner it's very subtle, and I usually round the shape of my lips because when I didn't, people thought I was mean far more often.

👉 Physician's Formula - 'Butter Believe It!' Putty Primer 


First-Impression Review: the first thing I noticed with this is the STRONG tropical fragrance. In the pot, it has a very soft humectant-like texture. I like for solid primers to be more 'pore-filling', but this did only slight work on my pores. With all the butters in the ingredients, &amp; after trying it - I'd say this is more of a hydrating primer. To apply it to the full-face like the instructions say, it really needed to be built-up, which caused a very greasy &amp; heavy feeling on my skin. I would say this would work wonders for those with very dry skin!  I'm naturally biased against it, as I have normal skin &amp; it's just not suited for my skin type.

👉 Maybelline - 'BB Dream Fresh' Skin Hydrating Beauty Balm 


First-Impression Review: this claims to be a 'sheer tint', &amp; indeed it is. It's very sheer. It's also NOT buildable in the slightest. I did appreciate that it made my skintone look more even, giving me just enough confidence with my skin. After application, it felt nice &amp; light on my face, &amp; not like I was wearing makeup. This is definitely the type of product I'd keep returning to for 'every day' use, as it's not mask-like, but flattering. There is no fragrance to this product.

👉 L'Oreal - 'Infallible Pro-Glow' Concealer 


First-Impression Review: this has got to be the EASIEST concealer to blend out that I've ever used. I mean, it took ABSOLUTELY no work for a completely blended, seamless look. I ended up getting about a medium-coverage out of it, which is great for pairing with current popular skin tints &amp; light-coverage foundations (as the concealer doesn't sit too heavy atop the base). It gave my undereye an extremely hydrated &amp; healthy look, &amp; I just really enjoyed everything about it. However - the fragrance is difficult to get past! It has a VERY strong chemical-like scent straight out of the tube.

👉 Makeup Geek - Compact Highlighter 


First-Impression Review: the common denominator in all the Makeup Geek powdered products I've tried recently is that they are all SO messy. I'm talkin' EXTREMELY 'ruin your outfit or carpet' messy. As soon as I lightly dusted my brush in the pan, the kickup was substantial!  It got everywhere! On the positive side, this is an incredibly beautiful highlight. It shines bright in normal indoor lighting, &amp; when tested - the reflect is extraordinarily bright. I had no issue applying or blending out this formula.

👉 Maven Beauty - 'Rose Water' Setting Spray 


First-Impression Review: I know I always say this, but it's truly difficult to do a 'First Impression' on a setting spray, as the product doesn't have many physical qualities. Here's what I do know about my first experience: the spritzer mechanism is really nice. Some might consider it aggressive, though. I prefer a more aggressive, yet expansive spray width. The fragrance is just 'decent'. It's not my favorite, but it also doesn't smell too much like 'rose' (as the title may suggest). My favorite part about this setting spray, is that within a few seconds after application, I could actually feeling it settling into my skin &amp; setting my makeup. Very few setting sprays actually achieve this, so I'm really happy with this one!

👉 L.A. Girl - 'Keep It Playful' Eye Palette 


First-Impression Review: the L.A. Girl formula is really hit-or-miss in my experience, but when it's good, I mean - it is MARVELOUS. This palette did not disappoint. The mattes that I used blended with simplicity, &amp; the metallics are show-stopping. They even pick up well on a brush! The only downside to this palette, is that there is only one depth-option, so your looks are going to pretty much always going to lead in the same direction.  Although I may feel slightly limited with this color-story, I feel it's a great little palette to have on hand when I'm looking for a specific eye-look that can be created fairly swiftly. Also, it's DEFINITELY one that I can depend on to perform successfully.

As a guy, can I use this sunscreen. I'm scared people might think I'm wearing make-up. I've taken pictures of my skin before and after, and can't really notice a difference but still a bit hesitant about using it.

I never buy the same product more than once because I just always feel meh about them. So, I'd love to know what your hands down gotta have makeup products are. I wanna know products that are so damn good that if they were to be discontinued you would stock up and protect your hoard at all costs. 

I have light skin, freckling, neutral undertones, green eyes, and copper hair. 

I'm 36 F and my skin tends to be dry dry dry (and even drier!). 

I'd love any recs for: 

* Primer
* BB or CC cream 
* Blush 
* Eyeshadow palette that would be great for daily looks but can also step in for a bit of glam every so often
* Eyeliner 
* Mascara 
* Brow pencil/gel/groomer

1625680723,Makeup,How to contour six-pack abs (aka styrene),"This is a widely requested body painting technique used to add more definition to the muscles, most popularly six-pack abs (aka styrene). There are a few things to keep in mind with  highlighting and contouring the abs:

&amp;#x200B;

* It’s a good idea to have skin tone foundations to start off
* Take note of natural shadows on your model’s body
* Go with the paints that match the natural skin tone and make it a little bit darker
* Shake up the paint bottle well and before pouring it into the airbrush, test a little bit directly on the skin of your model. See if you need to add any colors to match the natural skin tone for a more realistic look. Color theory will come in really handy here!
* Once you’re happy with the color, pour it into the airbrush spray
* Adjust PSI to the desired level and run a few tests on paper towel
* The areas of the body that move and create creases (such as knees, elbows) need to be elongated and scratched before you start painting on them. So if you’re contouring the model’s abs, ask them to stand up
* Follow the natural shadows and work section by section
* Research some photos of skeletal and muscular systems of the human body. They will serve as a great reference and help you train your eye to mimic the anatomy
* Adjust your viewpoint while you’re painting to get a better perspective
* Once you’re done with contouring, mix in some lighter colors for highlights
* Go on the perimeter of the shadow pairing the shadow with the highlight for a realistic look
* To remove any extra paint, take a sponge, rip apart the edge, put a little bit of water on it, and pull some of the surface color off. To tone down the colors, you can also blend in a little bit of setting powder using a sponge

Depending on the settings (outdoor vs studio), you can control how much heavier or lighter you’ll need to contour. Studio lighting tends to drown out the colors so it’s better to go heavier on colors. And on the contrary, it’s better to go softer if the model is planning on being in the daylight."

1625689873,Makeup,What are your thoughts on purchasing specific products for specific purposes?,"I was creating a peachy-orange monochrome look this morning and it got me thinking both in terms of this look and in general- how important is it to purchase specific items for each area of the face vs. using something you already have to get the job done? For instance, I needed an orangey blush which I don't own, so I just used some eyeshadow, and I've heard tell of MUAs limiting their collections by using products across the board instead of for one specific purpose (i.e. shadows for filling in brows and highlight/blush/contour, lipsticks as cream blushes, etc.).

So, is it all just marketing or does a gal (or guy) really need 19 different items to do a full face? I'm guilty of falling for the marketing for sure throughout the years, but I'm just curious what others think. Thoughts?"

I started getting into it more because I realized it’d make me feel better about my skin and eyeshape. I’ve been trying to find makeup I can get at drug stores that won’t make my already uneven/rough skin look worse. Essentially, I’ve hopped three foundations and concealers, and added a few extra things because I read some articles that all said the specific brand of makeup helps with uneven textured skin.   

The reason I’m writing this is because I was just in a store buying my third set of foundation and concealer and the other stuff, and my mom told me I shouldn’t because it’s too expensive and it probably wouldn’t work. She tried to convince me to try her powder foundation (and only the powder foundation) and not buy anything.

1622585612,Makeup,Makeup makes me look old and dull. Why?,"I'm 31 and I think I have pretty good skin. It's even with no scarring and no acne. It's neither oily nor dry. However, I do have dark under-eye circles. I'm pretty sure they're genetic, because I had them even as a child and no matter what I use or do, they don't go away. Now, the problem is that under eye makeup and foundation make me look like crap. I gave up on foundation ages ago since I don't feel that I really need it anyway. For under-eye concealer, I've tried different techniques -- brush, beauty blender sponge, fingers, expensive concealers, moisturizing concealers, concealers with retinol, concealers with a pink tint and a yellow tint, cheaper concealers from drug stores, etc. NOTHING works. I've tried putting it all over my under-eye, just in the corner, just on the lower part where the shadow is, thick, thin. It all looks horrible. It ends up looking dry (even though I don't have dry skin), getting in my fine lines, making my circles more noticeable (??). Lately, I've just been going sans-makeup except for my brows and a bit of blush. My face looks younger without makeup, but my under-eye circles are horrible nonetheless.   


The other night I went out to see a show for the first time ever. I was excited and looked up tutorials on how to get good under-eye coverage. I went out and purchased a $30 concealer that the lady said was super moisturizing and wouldn't crease. I put it on and of course it's the same thing. I swear it aged me by at least 5 years.   


Is there ANY way to hide my dark circles without looking 5+ years older? Am I doomed to have glowing skin when I don't wear makeup but have to suffer the dark circles?"

Anyways, when applying makeup such a concealer, sometimes foundation and especially powder it literally grossly flakes off/ gives me an insane amount of texture that isn’t there when I don’t have those products on. 
I thought that it was just the powder but my concealer, before setting does that too. 
I’ve tried a few drugstore concealers, loose powder, pressed powder. And even applying it differently, such as not baking, not applying it with a sponge, etc etc but I’m still left with a flaky textured mess.
For more back story I’ve been moisturizing like right before I do my makeup and it moderately makes this issue a little better but not at all by much.

I don't understand why Maybelline keeps this product in their line but not the balm refills. :("

1622648821,Makeup,Lost confidence and feeling like applying makeup is like putting lipstick on a dog,"I used to wear makeup in high school and it wasn't bad. I have hooded eyes (I'm white), but could get away with winged eyeliner. I have always had really good skin too, and for that, I'm very fortunate. In college, I felt I perfected it even a bit further, and I felt confident when going to parties, etc. 

Since covid started, I have barely left the house (I have a lung condition so I'm high risk). As a result, I have barely done my makeup. Usually, I feel average to below average in terms of my physical features. I'm 23 now, and when I do my makeup (for important work zoom calls, etc) I feel so ugly. I used to get a confidence boost, but now I almost feel worse after applying makeup. As I've gotten slightly older, I can't do my winged eyeliner anymore (and have resorted to a smokey pencil eyeliner look). My eyes are too small, too close, and uneven heights, my face is long (especially my forehead), my lips are too small, my jaw is too rounded front-on when I smile, and I have a very prominent ""roman nose""... I could go on. In the past, I felt effective at using makeup to ""fix"" my flaws, but now I feel like you just can't ""fix"" ugly. Part of me feels I totally need to revamp my makeup style/skills, but another part of me feels like ""what's the point"". Doing my makeup in the middle of the day to ""remind myself I can look pretty"" doesn't work anymore and I try not to take photos of my face anymore.

Has anyone else been in this situation?"

I’ve also tried the moisturizer, powder, setting spray, then foundation hack that was going around tik tok. Nothing seems to help. I can generally see it within 15 minutes of application, before I’ve even built up sweat or worn a mask. I have dry but otherwise clear skin and have even tried switching foundations.

Somedays I even do a shimmer in the crease. But the dark crease for me just doesn’t work anymore. Neither does full eyeliner to the inner corner. I can only do the outer half.

On the rare occasion I didn’t, people would ask me if I was okay and mention that I looked “sick” or “tired”. I’m starting to love the way my natural face looks (yay!) and find that when I put my makeup on, I hate the way I look...as if I’ve overdone it. It’s usually once I catch a glimpse of myself out in public and it’s too late. However, I don’t intend on going out bare-faced. I still enjoy getting made up and my skin tends to get a little hyper-pigmented. 

What are your favorite products for lightweight, no-makeup makeup looks? 

Any techniques that will help me achieve this look? I.e. applying creams or foundations with a brush vs a sponge?

1622732817,Makeup,i want to start client makeup but i have no base location ? what can i do ?,"I want to start client makeup but I have no location?

Hi guys , i’m 18 and I am somewhat of a beauty influencer . I’ve worked with brands on instagram and tiktok for campaigns such as Revlon, Lottie London, Makeup Revolution, etc. But in real life I want to venture out into client makeup because I know it would make a lot of money on the side and people love my work. 

However, I have two big issues: 
1- I live with my grandma and she doesn’t really like the fact that people can have her address since I go off to college in August and she’s scared that someone could potentially save her address and use it for a bad deed (especially if they see she’s the only other person there) 

2- I don’t have a car so I’d have to Uber/Lyft to work as a traveling makeup artist . 

My thing is, I could really only do traveling makeup artistry if I did group makeup in order to pay for the fee of the Uber/Lyft. I want to just charge a traveling fee but I know people around my age don’t want to pay a possible extra $20 on top of the $25 service. I also don’t want to undercharge my work ... I know i should be charging at least $30-35 but i would feel terribly bad and like I am overcharging if i make them pay that and the travel fee.

My favorite is serum foundations. I’m not a huge believer that you can add skincare to makeup. I think the two are separate. But, I like how natural serum foundations look and feel. And how you can have such a light coverage, but can also build it up. Also, I don’t feel like my skin is dying with it. 

 I also really like pressed powders. They’re like the fastest and easiest foundation to apply. I think it’s the best for beginners. Again, you can have a light and build it up.

Age rewind concealer- it's way too dry for a concealer product, exaggerates all the lines under my eye and feels like I have paint on.
Creamy matte lipsticks- This ones better than the rest of the products. It's very good to apply, shade range is good but it keeps rubbing off quickly. Why would one want to reapply lipstick every hour?

I know I have hooded eyes. I know foundation is supposed to match in natural light, I think anyways. My eyebrows started out blonde and darkened some but they're still relatively light, so I'll probably need to focus on them a lot. My cheeks are naturally flushed, idk if there's anything I can do to change that or if it affects anything regarding makeup. Lastly, I have fair skin with pink undertones

So I came accross this new skincare beauty cream which they are offering free 1 month supply of thier product as a trial and to test it before buying consistently, I mean for me the free trial bottle offer is very great but the down part for me is if you don't read it carefully you will be subscribed after a week or two to their beauty program automatically so if you dnt like the product you dont have to wait till first month ends you need to cancel after a week or before to not join the program, the product is very good and it has potential so having the free bottle for only paying for shipping is a good deal even though for some of us 10$ is alot just for shipping but on the other hand seeing the product and its use is worth it in my opinion. So bottom end is anyone who want the bottle for free can get it and if you dont like it or see potential cancel your program before you pay for it automatically you just need to read and becareful, thats all you need to be SMART! So I hope this review enlighten you for the product and hope you like the product like I did. I love it to be honest. Enjoy beautiful people.😊😊"

I had isotretinoin 7 years ago which cleared my face; I no longer have acne other than isolated pimples due to shaving irritation, face mask and so on, but no hormonal or sebum-related acne anymore. The thing is I was left with moderate acne scarring. It's not severe but under harsh lighting my scars are sooooo noticeable that I'd like to conceal them a bit. I tried dermaneedling and peels with little results other than texture improvement for a couple of months.

I know there are stronger treatments like subcision, ablative lasers, tca cross etc...but I'm too busy working, such treatments need long downtime/recovery with red/flaky skin.

Acne scars are difficult to treat even with expensive treatments, and I can't put up with all the hassle: traveling to go visit a good doctor, downtime, etc... After all, my skin is not that bad so it might be easier to conceal them when I'm working or dating someone, then use a cleanser at night to remove everything and let my skin rest whenI'm at home.

I don't wanna look made up, I was looking for something that can improve texture/lines etc...like silicon primers, matte moisturizers and things like these which contain silicons or ingredients which fill in pits. I know acne scars are deeper than pores and more difficult to cover, but there must be something which helps improving skin texture for people with scarring, even if it helps 25-30% improvement.

What should I do girls? I was thinking of a primer like benefits professionals?? Maybe something like effacer mat?

1) concealer
2) foundation ( for these two - I have acne prone combination skin that can get both greasy and dry at the same time and don’t like the suffocating/warm feeling that some foundation gives you - aka if there’s a good one where I can still feel like my face can breathe that would be great)
3) mascara (I have really long eyelashes that have a tendency to clump together with too much mascara, would also appreciate advice for this)

1623007432,Makeup,My theories on why high end makeup brands are losing so much of their hype.,"So we all realized by now that drugstore makeup is way more popular than high end and I came up with some reasons as to why it’s like that

1. No one “promotes” them anymore. People used to watch those famous creators like Tati Westbrooke and Jeffrey Star to get accurate reviews. Ever since they fell off (bec of their scandals) no one has been watching them so they kind of forgot about them and the brands they promote. (I’m sure there are people that still review them I just don’t watch them).

2. Sponsorships. They don’t really do sponsorships or collabs with a lot of famous creators so their new makeup is sometimes unheard of. Ex; morphe is doing really well w their collabs w Charli and Dixie Damelio, Avani, Madison Beer, James Charles (in the past), etc.

3. People finally decided to put quality over quantity. Not to say that high end brands aren’t good at all, there’s a lot of products that are amazing, but people are starting to realize they can get the same thing or of the same quality for much much cheaper, which is a big factor as to why drug store makeup is becoming way more popular imo.

4. Their makeup is outdated. By outdated I mean it doesn’t fit the ‘aesthetic’ of what people like nowadays. Fenty beauty, rare beauty, and some others I can’t think of rn are doing really well rn but a lot of them are still stuck in the 2016 heavy makeup phase which is not the trend anymore."

The problem is that I also am an EXTREMELY sensitive person.  So much so that if someone makes the slightest remark to me, I will never get over it.  This isn't on purpose.  Believe me, I wish I wasn't that way, but I am, and probably always will be.  I finally got the courage to start wearing makeup when I was 16, and was made fun of by my entire family every time.  Even my mother made fun of me.  A few years later, I had enough of being teased, and stopped wearing it.  I am now 33, and still too embarrassed to wear makeup.  I have only worn chapstick in all these years, but I am still teased me people for everything, and know that it will happen again with makeup.

I know that all of this is probably hard for you to understand, and you're probably rolling your eyes at me.  I get it, but it's just how it's always been with me, and it sucks.

1623090729,Makeup,Looking for a Genuinely Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner?,"This is a bit of an awkward question, but I was hoping maybe somebody more worldly than myself could help?   Long story short, I was born with a *lot* of eye problems, including frequent tearing up (which is not helped by my various allergies).  My mom has even dubbed my tears 'acid tears' as they seem to slowly but surely annihilate any eyeliner I apply (and I've tried all kinds and brands).    

Now, I don't really care too much about my everyday appearance (I usually stick with just three or four products, and I can fix most minor smudges), but I occasionally cosplay at anime conventions, and I have something very elaborate in mind (make-up wise) for the next one.  Which includes lower-lid lining, which I have never been able to pull off before due to no liner ever NOT running.  

So, does anyone know of a black, liquid eyeliner that WILL NOT RUN?  Please note, I'm not talking 'waterproof' here (I've tried dozens of those labels with little to no luck), but I mean one-step-below-exterior-wood-stain levels of durability.  I mean 'this is almost a tattoo' sort of staying power, because as much as I like Rocket Raccoon... I really don't want to look like I'm cosplaying him when I'm *not,* lol!  

Anyway, any help or suggestions are appreciated, particularly if you have personal experience with the product you have in mind!  And thank you for reading!   

&amp;#x200B;

(Some Extra Facts, if it helps: 

\-I have sensitive skin and prefer to stick with known-brands that are available in the US.  

\-I would like to spend less than $20 but am willing to consider saving up if a product has enough positive reviews/testimonials.  

\-I prefer liquid eyeliner with a brush-like tip, but will consider other methods if they're favored enough/high enough reviewed.  The 'black' color is a must, though! )."

I just noticed that they started putting talc in everything, even the Amazonian Clay powder and dimethicone is in many of their products. I don’t remember talc being in most of the products before and I don’t remember seeing dimethicone very often either. I can’t use that powder anymore. It makes me sneeze and I don’t like how they put inferior oils in the sugar rush lip oil. I also got a deluxe sample for the maracuja oil gloss and it was just okay. I have many tarte products but my newer ones just aren’t that good. I still love the liquid lipsticks but I also haven’t bought any in at least a year. My favorite is the Sugar Rush one in Cake Pop. Has anyone else noticed a change in quality?"
1623097955,Makeup,Beauty sponge for foundation and powder mistakes,"I have a few questions about applying foundation and powder:


How long do you wait after applying foundation to put on powder?

My foundation stays wet almost like forever, and I’ve been told to put less product on but it doesn’t even provide much coverage even when it says it does— milani conceal and perfect.

—

How do you apply foundation without the beauty sponge absorbing the product? 

I have tried dotting it on my face, putting foundation directly on the sponge, and only using my fingers for foundation. Fingers provide the most coverage but sometimes make my makeup look more cakey or dry or whatever. I think applying it that way might make it dry better for powder though but not sure, it’s been a while since I tried that. 

But this happens even with Fenti hydrating foundation, although that’s a bit better.

—

How do you apply powder so that it doesn’t look horrible on the face?

When my foundation is still a bit wet and when I use a sponge my makeup will look clumpy or cakey and like extra product clumps and looks horrible, not sure how to describe it. 

But when I manage to let the foundation dry (it’s usually hard to dry) then it looks very obviously dry. 

So I’m not sure at ALL how to apply translucent powder, both pressed and loose. I know technically how to swirl or use it but when actually applying it to my face just looks bad.

—
The only way my makeup has looked good in the past is with BB cream and Neutrogena powder foundation, but I want more coverage and to learn how to use liquid foundation properly!

Also, I use elf pore primer or hydrating, or I combine them. I’m not sure if applying too much of it makes anything worse above. I used to apply just a bit but my foundation would really settle into creased spots, and now it just still doesn’t look good. I’m so annoyed.

——
Products used/tried:

Elf hydrating and pore primer (combined or more of the pore one)

Milani conceal and perfect foundation
OR Fenti hydrating foundation

Elf pressed powder
OR Laura mercier loose powder

Milani make it last dewy setting spray OR Urban decay oil control lasting setting spray"

We went to Ulta and picked out some beginner friendly, natural looking products, and I helped him apply it that day. 

Even in Ulta he got really really overwhelmed and nervous. He hasn't used it on his own because he's unsure of what to do and really scared. I've tried to find videos and tiktoks of men doing basic makeup but it's all involved contouring, eyebrows, eyeshadow, etc, and he isn't ready for that (I guess that's the best way to say it.) 

The products we got him are the Colourpop pretty fresh tinted moisturizer, maybelline loose powder, maybelline cheek heat, loreal telescpoic mascara. He also has an eyeliner pencil and an eyelash curler.

I went to pride on the Cape this past weekend. I brought this rainbow palette I got from Colour pop last summer, Jawbreaker by Jeffree Star (I know I know, but it’s a good palette and I bought it when it first came out) and Strawberry Dream by Lunar Beauty (Manny MUA). I must say. strawberry dream outperformed the other two tenfold. I used all 3 for this look and the only colors that lasted through the day without fading or getting muddy were the ones from that palette. I own every single palette he’s released, not just because I truly like him as a person, but because he makes INCREDIBLE makeup. The color payoff is amazing, there is never any fall out, they literally blend themselves and are SO easy to use. I also used my ride or die highlighter, Medusa, from his greek goddess highlight palette from christmas a few years back and it goes perfectly under glitter. I will never not recommend anything by Lunar Beauty and Manny. the price point for an influencer brand is not bad, at $48 for a palette, it’s much cheaper than a brand like Huda Beauty. if it’s in your budget and you haven’t yet tried anything from the brand, I encourage it. any product. even the lip products are good."

1623123296,Makeup,"Just received the collab pallette from mochapbeauty and yassylashes, but I'm seriously disappointed.","Tldr: shipping took 7 weeks, pallette art is really blurry, there are several duplicate shades and the pallette has almost no pigment. 

I've followed these 2 brands on Instagram for a while, and I saw that they where releasing a limited edition collab pallette based around one of my favorite animes (fruits basket). I was excited for the pallette because it seemed like a good opportunity to try a new brand and get a cute new pallette. I placed my order with mochapbeauty because I had seen good reviews about her makeup and that her ship times weren't bad.

I ordered it on the launch date (note: not a preorder date) and this is where the issues started. I placed my order on april 25th, and it just arrived today, on june 7th. I know small brands tend to take longer to ship things, but there where people receiving their pallettes in mid may. On top of that, my tracking number (sent to me on may 17th) didn't work until yesterday, where it said it was at my local post office and had no other locations recorded before it, which is super weird.

Now for my issues with the packaging. I had seen a lot of people unboxing their pallettes that had come in cute boxes or glittery little mesh bags with some company stickers. Mine came in a blank envelope with some bubble wrap around the pallette and a large business card. No cute box, no cute bag, no stickers. This wouldn't really be a big deal, but I had been getting so excited after seeing so many happy unboxings and waiting for 7 weeks, it was a let down to say the least.

And finally, my issues with the pallette its self. When I opened up the package, the pallette has a cover on it that has the same design as the pallette, but it looks extremely blurry like it had been badly printed on. I'm not really bothered by it and assume they just didn't want to make a super high quality cover because it would cost more; Until I take off the cover and the pallette is the exact same overly blurred image. Then I open up the pallette to look at the eyeshadow. I see a lot of duplicate colors that are maybe a shade off from eachother. Hoping that they look different on, I swatch the pallette. 

4 shades* in this 15 pan pallette have any pigment, and those 4 shades come off looking like a double swipe of 2 eyeshadows. 10 other shades take 3 swipes to see anything, and I find 4 more shades** that look identical to another one in the pallette. One of the eyeshadows (the shade ""yasmin"") wont show up no matter how many swipes I do.

I dont want to send any hate, but I've never had an experience that was this bad with any makeup company, including other small indie brands. I dont want to be an asshole and ask for my money back from a small company, but this pallette is genuinely bad. 

I don't think I'm using it wrong, is it possible that I got a dud? Have any of you bought from either company?

I haven't worn makeup since I was 16 and my 21st birthday is coming up soon. For my birthday I wanted to go to Sephora a lipstick. I haven't bought very many things from make up stores and not since I was 16, the one thing I remember and I loved was
The Tarte Amazonian butter Lipstick. 
I looked on Sephora website for Canada, it's not there. Looks discontinued. I liked the ingredients, the way it felt and the colours a lot. I liked every colour they had. I usually don't like any other lipsticks so I've turned to here to ask, are any of tarte's other lipsticks the same? Is there another quality brand that makes a similar one? Definitely looking for shades like ethereal pink, angelic nude, coral blossom. 

Thanks for reading and any help.

Also: I live in Canada (Calgary) so I'd need something accessible to here and preferably something I can get in person. Maybe other cute natural makeup suggestions (I don't really contour or any foundation but I'm looking for like bb/cc creams) maybe from Tarte, would be lovely and I'll consider them, or skincare items that are worth the money (I have normal/ sensitive skin that breaks out a lot I think)"

1620099767,Makeup,Concealer brands / tips for DRY eyes,"Brief intro - I’m 21, and whilst I’m not a pro MUA or anything my makeup has always been nice for my face, I feel like I know what suits me and it goes pretty nicely. 

In the past year I developed eczema patches on my eyes which is another battle in itself. It’s left my under eyes and eyelids really dry no matter how much I moisturise!!! (Have tried many, only a couple are suitable without irritating tf out of my eczema). 

I’ve tried numerous concealers, currently using tarte shape tape. Whilst the coverage is good my makeup just looks horrible no matter what I do. I prime, blend my concealer with a damp beauty blender (brushes make my concealer look flaky) and set with LM translucent powder (baking is even more drying). I can’t not set my under eyes because they crease in 10 seconds. Set with UD all nighter setting spray after. 

I feel like the eczema has aged the skin around my eyes, and I just don’t have that smooth base anymore when I conceal, so I stay away from eyeshadow. My makeup literally doesn’t last at all and I have no idea what to do. 

Any concealers that you’ve tried that are hydrating with GOOD coverage as I have quite dark circles around my eyes would be really appreciated. Also any tips for how to save my makeup because it’s quite disheartening looking so crusty.

It's super disappointing because I adore green shades and I was so excited to create some fun looks but I just don't enjoy using because of the formula. 

The mattes are incredibly hard to blend and somewhat patchy. They're pigmented but as soon as you try to blend them out they look muddy. The shimmers are okay but the fallout is really bad, I try to do my eyes before my face but it's like the powder still comes off onto my cheeks throughout the day, if that makes sense. I've used two different primers, nyx glitter primer and the elf one. There wasn't much difference between the two.

My primary eyeliner is the ELF eyeliner pen because out of all the various applicators, it's been the easiest for me to apply and I like the more subtle ""coffee"" shade. I think it's about time for an upgrade, but I don't know where to start.

I'm looking for something very similar, but also an eyeliner that will last the entire day and applies a little more easily. (not using multiple swipes in one spot). I believe it's a very basic felt tip pen, but I've also not ventured out at ALL from elf because of budget. 

I'm don't like the way a full face feels or anything that will sit heavy on my face . I'm also a little lazy. Pencils and liquid applicators haven't worked well for me I'm the past so please don't suggest them. (unless they're even better suited for lazy ol me) 

Thank you!"

I don't want a full face of make up BUT I started googling and omg its so over whelming. Is there such a thing as a concealer I can use under my eyes that I don't need foundation or priming? I have tried two and they make me look like I'm wearing goggles lol. Honestly I dont even know how to put the stuff on so I know that doesn't help. Any one have youtube video I can watch for something so simple? This BB cream is interesting to me too. Can I just put it on my face and itd work like a concealer? Does it feel like foundation on your face or like rubbing in lotion? Can I apply it like I'm rubbing in lotion? Lmao I know so many questions. I appreciate you helping me. I don't feel beautiful these days and I'm trying to get my confidence back!

1620430426,Makeup,Urban Decay inked brow! How come I have discovered this product just now?,"Let me tell you my eyebrow situation: overplucked and completely missing ends. Years ago, I've had them microbladed and it didn't really help that much because it faded in few weeks to the point that I had to draw them with pencil or liquid pens anyway. Of course, that comes with all kinds of problems - I couldn't touch them because they'd smudge, even the waterproof ones are not that waterproof, the colour bleeds into surrounding skin, and they are not immune to my oily skin. 

I've decided I'll try Urban Decay brow ink that claims to last put for 3 days. I didn't expect it to last half a day if I'm honest but I was so wrong! When I tried the shade on my hand, it wouldn't come off even when rubbing it with make up remover wipes, or several hand washes. When I put it on my eyebrow, I've realised that the brush is easy to work with and there is possibility for even shading, depending how much of the liquid I put on the brush. It looks natural, matt and stayed on even after wiping with make up wipes, and 2 facewashes - 1 in the shower. I did try to avoid rubbing the brow area with face scurbing sponge but some really aggressive soap definitely went in. The very edges do come off a little after the shower but most of it is still on. The best features of this product are that it stays matte and I can touch my eyebrow anytime during the day. 

I am so impressed with it that I want to buy more products from this brand. What are your experiences? Also, did anyone try the microblading pen?"

I’ve been having a problem with it breaking though. I keep using alcohol to put it back together, only for it to shatter days after. 

I reconstitute in its original pan, should I be putting it into eyeshadow pans or something like that? 

Should I actively press it while it’s drying out? 

Are there any tips you can give me to help me preserve my sanity and my highlighter?

1620516667,Makeup,Recommendations for phasing out foundation (or at least not looking like I'm wearing it)?,"Hey folks. Due to past experiences with bad acne/hyperpigmentation, I have a bad habit of hiding behind foundation but I'm kind of over it-- I don't like the look or the feeling of foundation. I would love to go with a much lighter option (esp. since my skin is clearing a bit and I have a better skincare routine now) but I still have pretty bad skin, so I think some coverage is inevitable.

What lighter feeling/looking routines do you recommend for very oily skin with large pores and hyperpigmentation/redness? Longevity is an issue for me-- even a mattifying primer/foundation combo (both silicone based) doesn't hold up.

Less expensive recommendations are always better, considering I'm expecting to waste a lot of it trying different things until I find something that clicks. Also, I'm not necessarily 100% anti foundation-- just wanting to go a lot lighter, so if you happen to have an amazing light foundation recommendation, I'm open.

tldr: would very much love some ""no makeup"" or light makeup routine/recommendations for shitty skin."

1620591874,Makeup,"Can’t find makeup pale enough, I’m becoming desperate.","In the last month I’ve spent $350+ trying to find makeup that is the right shade for my extremely light skin, but every time I get anything I look like a complete and utter clown. Makeup used to really help me feel confident and empowered but now I just feel like a fool. I can’t stress just how defeating these past days have been. 

I don’t know what else to try. The lightest of IT? Way too yellow, even that miracle powder everyone I know swears by makes me look awful. The lightest of tarte? Too dark, again I look yellow and sickly. Benefit, L’Oréal, and Rimmel London are all also the same story. I just really want light makeup to help even out my skin tone, I’ve got acne prone skin and the tendency to pick from severe ocd. I’ve tried everything to stop, my doctor even mentioned that my skin picking boarders on self harm. I’m never going to have perfect skin, I’m always going to have bumps and redness. All I want out of a foundation/concealer/powder or whatever is that it smooths some of my redness out and maybe has SPF. I just want to feel like I look like myself. I’m sick of crying over this. I’m only 18 and every single shade I try gives me horrible lines and just makes me look so uncanny and yellow. I get mistaken for a boy a lot with my features and my name. As much as my androgyny is complimented, I can’t help but feel like a lesser woman when I get those comments. Makeup makes me feel better, more feminine, more attractive, but being entirely unable to find a shade that doesn’t make me look diseased is really chipping away at whatever confidence I’ve managed to scrape together. 

Is there anything I can do short of giving up or tanning constantly? Is it even worth trying at this point? If you couldn’t tell, this is really getting to me. I’m sorry for the long post, please be nice I’m open to almost anything that isn’t surgery or fake tan."

I had horrific adult acne from 18-21, then just oily/sensitive skin from 21-24, and now, as I near 25, it’s getting dry/flakey, still sensitive, and also simultaneously still oily on my forehead. 

This may come down to skincare regimen needing to change, but my makeup just doesn’t sit well like it used to. I use the same skincare and primer that I have for years now, and it keeps my makeup free skin happy, so I’d love to just find a different budget friendly makeup routine. 

I found a lot of joy in the L’Oréal infallible 24hr fresh wear, but now it’s flakey and dries me out. I don’t think my skin is quite dry enough for dewy foundation, so I’m stuck needing something in the middle. 

Powder wise, I use(d) the Coty airspun powder, as I loved how it locked everything in for the day; now it might be a little much, but powders have always been hard for me to get into/find. 

I value long-wear time due to my laziness and not wanting to touch up much. I would also like to stay under $20 for foundation, if possible. I’m pale (400 in Freshwear, if that helps at all) and it’s hard for me to match myself, haha. 

I like medium coverage, as I like to feel like I look fresh faced, but polished. 

Does anyone know of any under $20, medium coverage, somewhere between matte and dewy foundations for skin that appears to be going through a change?"

So I really want to try out the E.L.F. hydrating camo concealer, but because of COVID, the drug stores don't allow you to test the product (obviously). Right now I have the MAC mineralize concealer in NW20 which is like 2 years old and I'm still using it, but want to branch out into something cheaper.

What shade would be best in the E.L.F. concealer? I think I am cool toned since the MAC store matched me to NW20, but am confused how to translate that over to E.L.F.

Any help would be great! I don't wear a lot of makeup. Most of the time it's just a bit of highlighter and mascara. I want to start doing a fuller make up routine, but like in 5 minutes instead of 2 minutes haha."

1617466095,Makeup,Help me find a foundation I actually like!!," 

I have never really loved any foundation I have used and now I'm desperate honestly. The first foundation type product I used was Clinique tinted moisturiser (the old one) and I loved it however this was when I was about 13 and didn't have a single bit of oil or any blemishes so it didn't really have to do anything.

I developed acne as I got further into my teens and used Estee Lauder double wear for some more coverage, I loved it but after a while I got fed up as it just felt too heavy. I started using L'Oreal Infallible 24hr foundation and I just dealt with it, I didn't love it but it gave me coverage and lasted throughout the day it was also way too pink for my yellow undertone skin. I have also tried Clinique superbalance but it turned so orange and melted off my face, MAC Studio Fix but I didn't like the smell and it was too pale I could never find the right shade in, Armani Luminous Silk foundation made my face look like I'd submerged myself in a bottle of olive oil by the end of the day and all Maybelline foundations broke me out terribly.

And yes I have tried primers with the foundations that didn't stay on.

I need a foundation that does the following

1. Covers my acne (its not super bad anymore just a few blemishes and leftover scars)
2. Won't break me out
3. Will stay put
4. A nice finish, not too matte not too dewy just a skin like finish
5. Not too heavy
6. Won't turn orange or make me look like a ghost
7. Is available in the UK

I am relatively new to makeup and I am learning how to do winged eyeliner on my relatively hooded eyes. I watched a few video tutorials and they all say to do anything regarding the eyes looking forwards eyes open with relaxed brows, but I find it very difficult to get nice solid lines this way because if I don't arch my brows or close my eyes the skin above my eyes (the ""hood"" I guess) is just kind of very.. flappy skin? Sorry for the weird description lol but basically it is not taut at all and if I try to draw on it with a pencil or liner while it is in its natural state I always get terrible squiggly lines because I apply some pressure and it's very soft and foldy.

So currently I do my winged liner the regular method, which comes out well enough, but then a large portion of what does show of my lid is just black and I already have small eyes and I wear glasses (nearsighted) so I think it just highlights how small my eyes are. Despite that I do really like how winged liner looks on me otherwise and would like to make it look even better. Does anyone else have this issue and know what to do about it?"

My friend is letting us decide if we wanna get our makeup done for her wedding. Out of the 13 ppl in the bridal party, I'm the only one with this eye shape. I've scrolled though the hundreds on pics of the MUA and I only saw a pic of one person with my type of eye shape.To save money and just in case I dislike how they do my makeup, I'm thinking of just doing my own with what I have. I'm not an expert, but in the past year I've watched a lot of makeup videos hence I'm learning but also started getting more makeup as a result. 

Any tips/advice for bridesmaid makeup, regardless of what the outfit colors will be? Any unwritten rules I should know about such as the type/shade of lip product I should use(glossy, matte, etc.) or a certain eyeshadow color scheme?

Any tips to avoid flashback? I used Tarte Shape Tape and WnW Reserve Your Cabana and it was horrible flashback 😭 Is it a matter of the concealer being too light or applying too much powder with a wet BB or the application method or both?

In a nutshell, I have blonde hair, and naturally, my eyebrows are blonde as well- however, they’re not platinum blonde. They’re visible as an ash darker blonde. My eyebrows are also very thin, and I have no clue how to fill them in.

I always go for natural looks, so filling them in completely (like the way people who do full glam looks do) isn’t exactly my speed. Id love to have the look of soap brows, only that my eyebrows are so thin and light enough for it to look a little ridiculous when I try. 

Ive come to accept that ill have no choice but to fill them in, but I was wondering what products to use to achieve a more natural look?

By far the biggest issue I’ve had with many of my brow products is I can never find the right colour. Darker blonde looks to yellow for my ash toned hair, while light browns come off as way too red. 

Any tips, what style brow product would give natural looking brows for my so-thin-they’re-practically-non-existent brows? As much as products like brow gels are natural, they barely do anything for me as they can only fill and accentuate whats already there.

Also, any tips for brands that sell more ashy-toned colours?

1617747839,Makeup,I found a great Glossier Generation G Lipstick Dupe!,"Step 1:   Buy a Wet n Wild MegaLast Lip Color for like $2USD. It's a semi-matte lipstick bullet.

Step 2:   Lose it in an old purse or makeup drawer for 1-2 years.

Step 3:   Find it when cleaning things out. Check for signs of mold / bacterial growth / rancid smell.

Step 4:   If no clear signs of grossness besides the expiration date, dab it on your lips (don't drag) until you've achieved desired color payoff. 

No blotting needed, gives a soft, diffused look. Semi-sheer, matte texture...no mirror necessary. Looks shockingly similar to Glossier Generation G lipstick.

1617794826,Makeup,Minimalistic Summer Makeup Routine with only 3 Products,"*The heat’s on.*

Just like a stove, the temperature is shooting up. When it comes to makeup in summers, it is better to ***‘identify the essential, eliminate the rest.’*** 

The last thing one would like to do is layering up tons of makeup. Going minimalistic with minimal products is the best possible solution to avoid situations like melting of makeup due to excessive heat. No one wishes to carry loads of makeup. Rather one wishes to go minimalistic with the products too. 

Here’s **a short guide** for all of you who are looking for a **soft and light summerish makeup look** for a hot and humid day with **only 3 makeup products.** 

***For the base:*** 

***Using a concealer without foundation*** will help you get rid of those layers of makeup. A foundation might melt away due to soaring temperatures. A concealer would help in covering the dark circles, dark spots, or any other blemishes. Thus, say yes to concealer and no to foundation. 

**Applying a bit of loose powder** under the eyes would help in settling the under-eye. It also helps in making the makeup last longer.

***For the eyes:***

Apply the **left over loose powder** on the eyes with a brush to create an eye base. To add a tint of color, one can **use a lip tint** in shades of pink or peach. This would give the eyes a fresh and new look. 

**For the cheeks:** 

A **small amount of lip tint** can be used on the cheeks to give blush to the cheeks. The blush on cheeks gives a great lift up to the entire face. 

Blend the tint with your middle finger in a circular motion on your cheeks to get that perfect glow. 

**For the lips:** 

Of Course the lip tint was meant for the lips!

**Applying the same lip tint** on your lips would be great. You can also top it up with a lip color or a gloss for that perfect sheen. 

**P.S: The above makeup routine must be done after CTM (Cleansing, Toning, Moisturizing) for better and long-lasting results.**"

1617800896,Makeup,Which brands are vegan/cruelty-free and available in Germany?," high-endHi, there!

Currently, I’m looking for makeup that is cruelty-free and vegan. (I’m not happy about the fact we still need to test on animals instead of paying people to test it.) But for some reason, the big shops in Germany only sell the normal makeup brands (e.g., MAC). And those that are available and vegan are influencer brands that I don’t want to support (Jeffree Star, Kylie cosmetics).

I already thought about buying NARS. However, since they sell in China, they aren’t cruelty-free anymore.

Do you guys know brands that are vegan and cruelty-free and available in Germany?

P.S.: it would be cool if it’s high end. I want to have quality for the money I pay. Not just a name."
1617803189,Makeup,How do I make concealer not slow down the healing of a scab,"I'm a guy who does not use makeup, however recently I went very hard on a huge blind pimple on my forehead, and while it seems to be gone, I destroyed the skin in that area and now I have a huge scab. 

I think this scab is very noticeable and recently I wore concealer on it to hide it when I had a zoom date with a girl from uni. The concealer works fine from the webcam but I don't want to wear it outside as I do not want people to notice that I use makeup. I will see that girl again tonight for an online board games night with other friends, and on Saturday for a walk, so I was thinking of using the concealer again tonight.

However, I fear that using the concealer will slow down the healing of the scab. Especially when I remove it, I notice that the wound seems further from healing than when I put it on. Is there any way I can mitigate this?"

1617812326,Makeup,Eye shadow creasing help,"I didn't used to have an issue with creasing too badly, but since I upped my skin care routine I guess it has made my lids a bit greasier and I am not sure what to do about it! 

I don't have luck with any of my current primers. The ones I've tried are Anastasia (hate), UD Potion Primer (used to work, less productive now), UD anti-aging pp (seems too greasy), and Smashbox (best of the bunch). At first i thought the UD anti-aging pp was just a greasier formula, but now it's happening with all of them. I have the best luck with the Smashbox, but it's not perfect and still creases many days after not many hours.

I would take suggestions for how to clean my lids better before application, how to apply my products without interfering with my makeup, or product recs.

1617885312,Makeup,New to using liquid foundation: How to stop it looking patchy/flaky after application?,"Hi folks! 


I've found a colour that seems to compliment my skin tone (doesn't make my face change colour but seems to ""smooth"" it out and thus far have been trying a brush but I've noticed that it seems to look a little patchy especially on my cheeks/nose as though perhaps there hasn't been quite enough product. 


My routine is as such:


- Double cleanse
- Serum
- Moisturise
- Prime (after about 5 mins to let moisturiser ""set"")
- Apply foundation (after a couple mins)


I have combination skin and apply a couple of pumps to the back of my hand before using the brush to apply. Mostly it feels more as though perhaps the product just isn't actually going very far (if that makes sense) and that the ""patchiness' is where there isn't enough product to actually provide a base.


I've watched quite a few videos and they all seem to be using around the same sort of amount I've used so I'm not sure if it's a case of my technique and needing practice, or considering that every skin is different and being brave enough to apply a bit more. I'm very new to make-up in general so there's a bit of ""oo that looks like a lot..."" going on.


Any general pointers would be much appreciated and yes, I know I'm overthinking! xD"

1617927534,Makeup,Product Recommendation: Touch Up Powder for Oily Skin,"Hi y'all!

The summer heat is hitting hard already and my oily skin is having field day. I rotate a few different foundations, but my oil control primer isn't really controlling the oil. Does anyone have any recommendations for a touch up powder that I can use to get rid of the oil , but not wipe away the makeup? Drugstore options are preferred, please !

I do use the Beauty Bakerie setting powder in the morning. It helps prevent the makeup from breaking down when I get oily, but it's not purse friendly. I don't use any setting spray, they just don't make a difference for me."

1617932321,Makeup,ABH Brow Freeze Wax vs Surratt Expressioniste Brow Pomade - Thoughts?,"Hey all,

So I've recently given into the hype and tried out soap brows - and I'm obsessed. I've been using the Pears original translucent soap as recommended, but after three days of use it has caused major irritation to my skin (red, itchy, flaking etc. - not cute). 

I'm looking for an alternative product, specially formulated for daily cosmetic wear and have heard great things about the Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Freeze Wax and the Surratt Beauty Expressioniste Brow Pomade.

Has anyone tried these, and if so which would you recommend? I'm looking for something that will keep my brows in place soap brow style, without any skin irritation or weird white flakiness from the wax.

Thanks, you'd be a lifesaver! x"

1614700284,Makeup,Ben Nye SK-1 Tattoo Cover?," Hi everyone,   
I've watched multiple Youtube videos about covering tattoos with makeup but I still have a few questions that I was hoping some of you could answer! 

  
I have a tattoo on my forearm that's around 4 inches, a pretty simple abstract tattoo, so it's mostly made up of black and light blue lines (with one small area, around the size of half a pinky, that's shaded black). 

  
I was wondering if Ben Nye SK-1 (Cover-All Wheel) could cover this easily and quickly?

Also, is SK-1 (Cover-All) as pigmented as NK-1 (Conceal-All) or SK-11 (Tattoo Cover-All)? 

I only have access to SK-1 so I was wondering if it offers the same amount of coverage/pigmentation as the others, especially Tattoo Cover-All, or is it just the colors/shades that are different.

Thanks so much!   
Also, please feel free to share any tattoo stories with me...I love hearing about people's tattoos!"

1614830056,Makeup,Teen girl looking for advice: Where to start with makeup?," Ignore eyeshadow, lipstick, eyeliner, mascara. I think I know enough to get by for now.

My main problem is with stuff like foundation, concealer, BB cream, primer, setting power, etc. Also I know nothing about contouring or highlighting (I've just seen it mentioned on reddit before). If it's relevant, I'm South Asian-American (more specifically, Indian).

Not sure what exactly each thing or product does, what purpose it has, what order I should use it in, what can I get away with not using, what I should use, how to use it, etc. I'm aiming for a general 'no-makeup' look, something that I could easily wear everyday without looking over the top.

Any guides I can look into? Could someone explain this or link to something which does?"

1614866262,Makeup,Looking for a Particular Estée Lauder Item. Can Anyone Identify?,"Hi All,
Yesterday I received an ad from Macy’s which showed an Estée Lauder Pure Color Envy lipstick as part of a free gift. However, this is not the normal Pure Color Envy packaging but has instead a [tropical/palm tree theme](https://imgur.com/a/gWW6o0q) on the tube.   

The ad did not give any other information as to whether this is a particular special edition or only available as the free gift, etc. I reached out to both Macy’s and Estée Lauder separately, but they just keep pointing me to the regular Pure Color Envy line. Since the free gift is only available in store and I am not shopping in-person because of the pandemic, I am unable to procure this item as a free gift, but would be willing to buy it outright if I could find it online. Does anyone know if this is some sort of special edition packaging/the name of it? Or any similarly themed items?

I’ve been getting pretty frustrated with liquid foundation. It seems like every trick I’ve tried just makes my makeup look worse. When I put my liquid foundation on, I use a beauty blender and dab. Depending on the day, my skin either ends up looking dry and crusty or the makeup looks like it’s not even sitting on my skin at all (oily and separated looking). My makeup is always either cakey from looking dry or cakey from looking oily and separated. I always exfoliate gently and moisturize before the makeup. I’ve tried a layer of translucent powder before the foundation, I’ve tried using oils to mix with my foundation, I’ve tried damp sponges and dry sponges, blending more seems to just rub my makeup all the way off, blending less leaves it looking cakey still. I have no idea why my skin hates makeup so much!"

👉 Revlon Photoready 'Prime Plus' Makeup + Skincare Primer 


First-Impression Review: really did give my skin a 'perfected' look, but left my hands both greasy AND sticky-feeling. It also has a really yuck scent, which went away, but wasn't pleasant. I do love the way it works, &amp; apparantly it has long-term use benefits.

First-Impression Review: annoying AF packaging - the pump didn't work at all, so had to pour out my desired amount. Luckily, it looked absolutely beautiful on my skin, so it had a saving-grace. I LOVE the coverage, the finish, &amp; the color-match.

👉 Hard Candy 'Marilyn Monroe' Loose Airy Powder 


First-Impression Review: feels like an HD powder, which did NOT excite me. However, it applied perfectly, &amp; set my foundation like a high-dollar powder. Absolutely no complaints about its performance. There is a 'sparkling strawberry' added-fragrance (which I personally REALLY enjoy). The only downside is that this little powder is SO messy, &amp; will literally get in places you have no intention of putting powder.

👉 Found 'Baked Illuminating' Blush 


First-Impression Review: I absolutely loved how this looks, how it works, &amp; the fact you get such a huge amount of blush in the pan. It does give a luminous glow, so if you aren't into that - you definitely won't like this. It also shows up more 'pink' than it appears in the pan.

👉 ELF Illuminating Palette 


First-Impression Review: high-hopes for this palette that were totally let down. It does NOT give you the sought-after glow that many seek - but it's quite dim &amp; soft. I am giving it an average rating, because for 'everyday' wear, I like something a little more shiny, but I truly believe there is a place in my collection for this. There ARE occasions where I don't want it to look like I'm wearing any highlight, &amp; this would be perfect for that.

👉 BPerfect Cosmetics x Stacey Marie 'Carnival Palette' 


First-Impression Review: I've waited seemingly forever for this palette, &amp; it was such an experience using it for the first time. It was even better than I hoped it would be.

I am very insecure and have a lot of issues and as a result, I never gave makeup a shot, mainly out of the fear of being laughed at.

\*I am a brown girl.(IDK, it might be an important fact)

I don't have a lot of money to spend on cosmetics as of now. So, Here is what I have in mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to learn a very easy and basic gothic eye makeup that stands between basic and extreme. It should be something i could wear to college. 

The look  I was considering is something like a redish base coat that fades into the black. You probably already figured out the look I am talking about. It a common goth look. 

How do I go about achieving that look?

What are the cosmetics I will need?

And if any creator is watching can you please make a tutorial on the same for a beginner.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I have figured, I will need a concealer, eyeliner, kohl, black and red eye shadow, Brushes and tape. 

is this how i should go about doing this?

First apply the concealer on my upper and lower eyelids. Then apply the red eye shadow. Then apply the eyeliner and mix it with the red eye shadow and then blend it with black eye shadow. Should that be enough? Am I missing something?

I have inserted an image of me [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/vXRy7gm)  if it would help."

Since I've replaced it, I noticed that my eyelashes hold a curl for about 10 seconds. By the time I get my mascara on, they're sticking straight forward. I tried waterproof mascara because I read it holds a curl better, but that didn't seem to make any difference. 

Has anyone else encountered this/have a solution? I'm about to take the rubber pad off the ELF one and see if it works that way, but I know that squeezing your eyelid between two pieces of metal probably isn't ideal.

I grew up watching makeup gurus, like Jaclyn Hill, Makeup Geek, etc. i remember they’d always start off their eyeshadow looks with a light, transition shade and gradually go in with darker shades. I’ve seen tutorials where people will pack the *darkest* color first, then blend it out with lighter colors. Both methods seem to always produce flawless results. 

I want to get better at eyeshadow, but pigmentation and muddiness is always an issue for me. If i start with light shades, my eyeshadow isn’t as pigmented as i’d like it to be. If i start with dark shades, i feel like my shadows get “lost” with blending, and it can be muddy. I know it’s not an issue with my primer or brushes, since i have pretty good ones to work with. 

which method do y’all prefer?"

I have been working remotely for a year now, and just stopped wearing makeup this whole year. Some of my makeup was close to needing replacement before COVID, so I have no clue what to order as a replacement now a lot of those things are discontinued. Now that I need to start going back into the office, I'm lost and overwhelmed. 

My details: Skin tone- Usually the lightest color- Porcelain (I burn or get occasional freckles, but I've never tanned. SPF is my friend!); Eye color- Green/Blue depends on what I'm wearing; Hair- Medium brown; Age- newly in the 40s; Color palette: Natural looks (Cool or Neutral colors. Yellow hues make me look sick.)

What I need help replacing:

\- Laura Geller's Luminous Veil Cream foundation stick: I just need a foundation to touch up and even areas out. This stuff was great at just spreading a little where I needed it. It also did not melt or sweet off in humidity or heat, which is a constant here from May-September.

\- Eyeshadow: My eyeshadow was so old the label is unreadable and it didn't seem to last in humidity, so I'm open to suggestions. I need non-glitter color palettes in cool/neutral colors. I'm open to suggestions of creams or powders."

1615324305,Makeup,"Lip Stain: water-based ""markers"", like Covergirl Outlast?","I love lip stains that are buildable, water-based and that actually ""stain"" or pigment lips for an extended period.

My favorite ever has been the Covergirl Outlast lip stain ""markers"", because of the consistency of the product, that you can apply the stain very precisely to your lips, and that it actually provides a sort of temporary, natural-looking ""dye"" to lips.

Most ""lip stains"" that I come across are more like long-wear lipsticks in that the pigment doesn't sink into your lip skin; instead, it sits on top. 

Has anyone found anything similar to the Covergirl Outlast line? Or any other lip stains that are truly just water-based ""dyes"" to apply to the lips?"

Nyx Can’t Stop Won’t Stop Concealer in Pale- too dark. looked yellow.

that I wanted to share.

How common is it for you to see people with blush and highlight on their nose, out in public? 
Like highlight on bridge and tip of the nose, and the blush is also peeking through under the highlight, if that makes sense!

I’m asking cause I totally love it and I think it’s a top tier makeup move (my opinion though!) Something about the blush + highlight combo that makes me fall in love with it!
Highlight on the cheekbones too! But I haven’t been doing it on the cheekbones cause I’ve been obsessed with blush lately.

Anyways, as an avid wearer, I don’t think I’ve actually seen a lot of people adding blush + highlight on their nose or maybe it’s just more subtle? But then again, everyone’s wearing masks where I live, so I can’t even tell if someone did have it on! 

Just wanted to see if it’s actually a common makeup routine that people do. You know, aside from only seeing it on TikTok, since it’s pretty common there. Thanks! :)"

I wish to cover up JUST the mole for videos I will be doing, so I want to account for extreme lighting I guess? not sure if that's a thing

also the above photo is not me, I'm a man you see and i've not used makeup save for one or 2 instances in the past, so please use brand and type and names or anything ill need to find it

another thing i'm of darker asian complexion, is this something I can get right buying from online if not which shop sells make up (UK/London based)

overall a simple/single method if possible please if not whichever would work the best please

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried everything I can think of over the last few months, from different brushes, foundations, skincare, primers and it always seems to end with the same result. It's bad from the moment its applied but does get worse as the day goes on.

I thought I had it figured out, along with proper skincare I bought Skinbase and Hydraveil from Illamasqua thinking I'd be onto a winner. It's somehow worse. To be honest the last foundation that actually looked good on my skin was Elizabeth Arden, the cream foundation that came with the sponge in the 00s haha. But i've never had a good coverage that doesnt leave a terrible texture since.

I basically want to make my skin look more even and to shape my face a little (I'm thinking soft instagram filters here). What do I need to get that effect? 

I actually want to look masculine while wearing my make up. Does that make sense or am I just crazy? 😂 All the make up tutorials seem to be for girls or by guys who want to look fem and basically use the same techniques than them.

I also use Kora organics noni radiant eye oil instead of a typical eye cream so I feel like with that and my cream and liquid makeup it’s almost too much glow. Hopefully using a setting powder will also help my eyeshadow to stay put better and longer. 

I’m looking for a setting powder to use only around the eye area. Preferably something translucent.  Right now I’m pretty fair. I used to self tan a lot before I had my baby and will start self tanning again eventually when I find the time lol. So something that works for fair and tan skin. 

Hate the cakey powdery look. Really trying to avoid that. I’d rather not wear any setting powder if it ends up looking like that. 

Also a huge bonus if the packaging isn’t messy. I like the idea of pressed powders but I feel like there are way more loose powder options.

......

➡️ NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding the product quality. As always, use/buy the makeup that makes YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun.

......

📌 La Mer Micellar Water 

▪️ Why: I save this for best, &amp; boy - does it give an experience! The fragrance is soothing &amp; spa-like, &amp; the 'feel' of the product is absolutely refreshing. I'm almost out, &amp; will definitely splurge on another one because it literally brings me joy. 

💰 Price: $95.00

......

📌 Colgate Whitening Liquid Toothpaste 

▪️ Why: I'm really big into dental hygiene, &amp; I keep about 5 or 6 toothpastes in circulation, so I never get bored. I just got this one last month, &amp; it's wonderful! It cleans so well, gives me bright teeth, &amp; keeps my breath fresh. Highly recommend. 

👅 Flavor: Crystal Mint

💰 Price: $1.00

......

📌 Glossier Stretch Concealer 

▪️ Why: I used this for my 'Shop My Stash' this month, &amp; I legitimately cannot get enough. It looks SO good under my eyes, which are prone to definite creasing &amp; dryness. Not with this concealer! Plus a little goes a long, long way, so the money is well-spent. It plays well with skincare, foundation, AND powder. I love it. 

🕶 Shade: G12

💰 Price: $18.00

......

📌 ELF Blush/Bronzer Duo 

▪️ Why: Definitely here for the bronzer. The blush isn't that great, but it's worth the money JUST for the bronzer. It's absolutely gorgeous on the skin. It shows up, it's blendable, it builds, &amp; the shade is perfection. It's just a bonus that you get a blush, too. 

🕶 Shade: St. Lucia

💰 Price: $4.00

......

📌 Hourglass Arch Brow Micro Pencil 

▪️ Why: During my 'First Impressions', I wasn't SO stoked about it, but having used it every day for a month, I found that I've seen the light. The shape of this pencil just works. I typically use 3 products in my brows (the picture ONLY shows the pencil), but I'm just so amazed at how well it outlines, fills in patches, &amp; builds - all without being waxy. It's a definite win. 

🕶 Shade: Blonde

💰 Price: $28.00

......

📌 Half Caked Liquid Lipsticks 

▪️ Why: Can I just say, 'Wow'? These are the BEST Liquid lips I've used up until this point in my life. They are creamy, comfortable, bold, non-transferable, smell great, &amp; long-lasting. I also dig the shape of the applicator, because it allows you the precision to line your lips with the same product. It also has a small dip in it, so it maintains enough lipstick on the wand to reduce the amount of dips. These are just simply stunning. 

🕶 Shade: Theme Song, Low Key, '82 Bordeaux

💰 Price: $12.00/each"
1612125121,Makeup,Favorite eyeshadow brush?,"I usually use one matte color for eyeshadow, occasionally I’ll throw in a shimmery pop in the inner corner or in the center of my lid.  I’d like to find a brush that blends evenly over my entire lid and doesn’t leave the edges looking splotchy.

I scrolled down to find out that since I have been inactive for 12 months, my 957 points I carefully accumulated over the years have EXPIRED Jan 1,2021! Can not be used.

I called their customer service who read a script that there was nothing they could do to reinstate the points.  I did not receive any emails or warnings about this expiration.   We are in a pandemic and I have not been to my beloved Garden State Plaza (NJ) shopping mall since February 2020.  I didn't even redeem my birthday rewards this year which was a total first for me. Today I went to make a purchase and this is what I find.   I am extremely disappointed in Sephora and will no longer be giving them my money.

since coming off of birth control 2 years ago, my skin has been acting crazy. The worst area is my eyes with my under eye area being extremely dry while my lids have become CRAZY oily.

while I was still on BC, eyeshadow would last all day on me. Now even after applying primers and adding a setting spray once I'm finished, my shadow will be completely gone within a good hour or so.

I'm super frustrated about this. The only brand somewhat lasting on my eyes is Charlotte tilbury, but I have so many old palettes I wanna use again :( do any of you have some advice on what to do? the shadow will stay on close to my lashline, but on my lids and crease it just disappears within what feels like minutes. When I was still on BC, even the poorest quality drugstore palettes would stay for what felt like ages.. 

Help this frustrated gal out please :(

I am so lost when it comes to make up and I feel like everyone recommends different products and different ways to apply. If I could just have someone show me exactly how to do it based on me it would be so helpful!"

I use other lip balms/chapsticks such as Neutrogena's Norwegian Formula Lip Moisturizer (SPF 15), Kiehl's lip balm #1, Bert's Bees, and even Etude House Melting Chocolat Lip Sleeping Mask--yet no burning sensation with any of these products/brands. 

Could this be a possible allergic reaction of some sort? Or is the product expired/bad? I was wondering if anyone else has had the same feeling when using Banana Boat's lip balm as I have only seen comments made about Burt's Bees burning lips."

I'm uncovering so many layers of judgement I've internalized from childhood/teen years, and remembered these gems:

""Makeup is for ugly girls."" My dad would tell me...

""Really?? "" My mom said rolling her eyes at me for putting on (clear!) mascara when I was 12

""Natural is best"" 

""You look like a clown"" My sister said to me when I snuck eyeliner (I'd stolen) to school to put on in the girls bathroom. 


× I am 27 now and wanting to learn to wear makeup for the first time(for empowerment and self love).

 I realized recently how much I avoid looking in the mirror, when my husband showed me a picture of myself he photoshoped with blonde hair (I wanted to see what it would be like if I could bring myself to get my first professional haircut and color) I recoiled and tears were in my eyes. ""Wow I thought it was cute."" He said . Then I realized it's my face I couldn't even see the hair somehow..., I have such a hard time looking at myself, I don't feel like the face in the mirror is me. I wear loose clothes and no makeup all the time and assumed it was due to being a hippie natural type but really now I'm tired of it. I feel infantalized , I know it's not just ""being natural"" there is something alot more insidious going on. I've always been ""cute"" but that's it I want to feel like a woman not the dumb kid I feel like. I want to feel sexy... I'm too shy to even say the word sexy out loud. 


××
I've gotten stuck with shadows of shame , guilt , and ""feeling silly"" about doing anything to care for myself. I think makeup or no makeup on other girls is totally beautiful and I seem to only reserve this hate and judgement for myself. The cynical voice tells me I'm wasting my time, but I'm not taking that for an answer anymore. I'm tired of living in the shadow of who I could be."

To keep things nice and simple for our EU customers, we've adjusted our pricing so the price displayed at checkout will be the final price you pay. Please be sure to check the correct shipping country is selected when on site, to view the correct prices.”

1612368290,Makeup,Patchiness and creasing while trying to apply and blend bright blue/purple/green etc. eyeshadow shades - How to prevent this?,"I don’t know about you guys, but for me, when it comes to bright warm toned eyeshadow shades (I.e. bright yellows, oranges, reds, pinks, etc.) they’re always so easy to pack onto the eye and blend. However, bright blues, purples, and green type shades are ALWAYS a bit of a struggle for me.

When I do blues/purples/etc., I usually try to start with a light transition shade and then add layers to darken it, which typically works decently, but then when I want a lot of pigment to a certain area (like on my outer V for example), I go in to pack on the shade, and it seems like no matter WHAT, it creases or doesn’t blend well, even after going back in with a clean blending brush or trying to blend it with lighter shades. 

Does anyone have the same issue or know why this is? What do you do to prevent it? I’ve had this issue with both higher end and drugstore brand eyeshadows. I usually use Tarte Shapetape concealer as a primer for bright eyeshadows, but I’m wondering if it’s the primer I’m using, my application/blending technique, or if it’s just practically inevitable?

1612396618,Makeup,What undertone is this foundation??,"Hey there so I’m actually colorblind lol. It’s a form of red green colorblindness but it’s pretty moderate so it’s not like my color vision is that bad. I can tell the undertones of foundations - cool/pink, warm, etc. I’ve just always had a hard time buying a foundation that fits my skin color (all were drugstore though). Like literally the only thing that was a perfect match was a foundation that I got matched at Sephora. 

Today I FINALLY had a perfect match from the drugstore. It’s the Maybelline Dream Radiant Liquid in Sandy Beige. I’ve been trying to train my eyes to spot out good match foundations with reference from the 1 foundation that fits me. The foundation is the Bareminerals Pro Longwear Foundation in Butterscotch 15.5 (it’s a powder) and Sephora describes it as a medium neutral with peach undertones. I always thought I was a neutral undertone but sometimes neutral foundations are a tad too pink for me while the warmer undertones were too yellow/dark. 

I’m just really glad I finally got it right for a drugstore foundation because I thought I could never try drugstore foundations with the luck I’ve had. 

[Foundation Pics ](https://imgur.com/gallery/8QxHtcQ)
I included swatches with and without flash and then a picture of the bottle. I think it’s on the light warm side but I’m not quite sure what a peach undertone is supposed to look? Also, sometimes I’ll play around with Sephora’s shade finder with the bareminerals foundation to see what my shades in other brands are and I’ve gotten olive undertone shades recommend which confuse me."

The other day I was scrolling on Instagram and I was caught up so it was showing me people I don't follow. I came across a person who was doing something makeup related. Clicked on her page and scrolled a bit and saw this really incredible prismatic swatches. Went to the brand page and then their site... A lot of the site was sold out. 

I left Instagram and when I went back it was all gone. The brand and every trace of how I got there. I can't stop thinking about this collection though, and more importantly it will just bother me if I never find it.

At some point I definitely saw that the brand was out of the West Coast of the US - could be Oregon? The branch name definitely had a D in it. The palette was maybe six-seven prismatic shadows and like $96? Somewhere around there. They did have single shadows that were in the $8-$14 range - lots of greens, blues, purples, etc. When I say ""lots"" I mean that generously - it was a smaller brand, for sure...

I think they had eye makeup and maybe skin care? But I didn't click on that so I'm not sure what was involved there. 

Anyone have any clue what this is?"

I never was much into beauty and so.  But want to catch up now and learn how to.  
And I have atopic skin that tends from time to time to turn into eczema.  So most of the time I use just some moisturizer like Mixa. And my best look is an eyeliner with some concealer for dark circles under the eyes.     
I want to learn how to do all these nice eyeshadows and other tricks.   
But how to prepare the skin and how to clean after?"

Then I tried Too Faced Shadow Insurance primer but it was really greasy and the liquid separated, even when i tried to store it in different positions and shaking it before use. My most recent is Anastasia Beverly Hills eye primer, and the formula is so thick and opaque even with the smallest amount, so I have to layer eyeshadow so heavy just to try to cover it up, and it does not blend into my dark skintone at all.

1612969042,Makeup,"I just released an app for makeup, called GlamKit, a virtual makeup bag, organizer, and planner","I recently released a free app, called GlamKit. It's an app that helps you organize and plan your makeup, specifically eyeshadow. Add your eyeshadow palettes, scroll through all your shades, and plan breathtaking looks.

iOS App Store: [https://apple.co/3jxU4N7](https://apple.co/3jxU4N7)

Google Play Store: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glamkit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glamkit)

Website: [http://www.technegames.com](http://www.technegames.com/)

More information about the app:

See all your eyeshadows in one place.

* No more searching through endless palettes for that perfect shade.
* Easily import a picture of your eyeshadows and divide up the shades. GlamKit will do the rest for you, finding the color and finish of each shade.
* All your eyeshadows will be in one scrollable list. You no longer have to open all your makeup as you create your look. It's like shopping your own collection.
* Scrolling through the list is also a great way to get inspiration directly from your collection. It helps you get more creative with your looks.
* Sort the shades however you want, such as by color, finish, or palette. You can also sort by your favorite shadows, darkest shadows, or lightest shadows. It makes it much easier to find the perfect shade you're looking for.
* No more forgetting colors or using the same few palettes when you have so much makeup gathering dust. You might just find your new favorite shade.

Create looks and save them for another day.

* GlamKit makes recreating your favorite looks so easy.
* You can now plan your makeup anytime, even when you're not home.
* It makes packing your travel bag faster and traveling easier. You no longer have to worry about leaving an important palette at home.
* Doing your makeup will be quicker because you've already saved plenty of looks.

Find your precise color using a color wheel.

* Perfect if you're copying a face chart or have a dream color in mind.
* Have you ever had a very specific shade in mind for a look? Or maybe you're copying an inspiration? Instead of searching through endless palettes, simply find the color on the color wheel. Then, GlamKit will show you the closest shades in your collection.

Compare other palettes to your collection.

* If you're shopping, you can just upload a picture of a palette you're considering. GlamKit will show you all the similar shades in your collection. It's a great way to save some money and avoid buying an almost identical shade for the hundredth time.
* If you're trying to recreate a look that you saw on Instagram or Youtube, just upload a picture of a palette that the original artist used. You can easily find dupes in your collection. It saves you time because you no longer have to spend time comparing swatches or Googling dupes that you might not even own.

Customize details about each of your shades.

* Add details, such as price, weight, rating, tags, and more, to make it easier to remember which shades you love to use.

GlamKit is still in early development. I’ve only been working on it for a few months. There’s many more features planned:

* Filtering swatch lists based on color, finish, rating, tags, and more to make it easier to find that perfect shade in your collection.
* Making swatch lists searchable to make it even easier to find the shade you have in mind.
* Adding photos of swatches to each shade, including in different lights, in case the shadows look different than in the pan.
* Adding photos of your looks and dates that you wore a look.
* Adding notes and estimates of the time it will take to do a look, to make it easier to plan your mornings.
* Sharing your looks and collection with friends, so you can show off your gorgeous makeup.
* Improving finish detection.
* Adding features for iridescent, multichrome, and duochrome eyeshadows to support your full collection.
* Face, lips, sfx, and other product sections to help you create a full face look.

It would be great if you could check it out. It’s completely free. If you have any questions, feature ideas, or found any bugs, please feel free to contact me. Thank you and have a great day!

1612973091,Makeup,Brow Wow!," Got sick of using makeup (and precious time) to fill my brows so I went for combo brows (microblading and powder brow). I was so impressed with the whole process. They turned out fabulous and it was virtually pain-free! I was on the fence about the whole thing but I'm loving the results. I posted a poll (blading, shading, or both) a while ago and got different opinions and after talking to my stylist decided combo was the way to go!

I explained I had make up but was very old and even older make up brushes. A very nice person said to get rid of my make up and brushes if I had opened it and used any because of bacteria and other bad things. so following her advice I got rid of the make up and brushes (now brushes for my husband's painting) and got brand new brushes.
The ones I got where the mermaid tailed makeup brushes. I think I went a bit overboard because half of these brushes I don't know what they are used for. If anyone has a guide for what brushes are for what that would be amazing. 
Second I know I asked this in the comments but most of the places people said to get a make up consultation are currently not doing consultation in my city due to the pandemic (sephora). I don't have a CVS near me and most salons that do makeup consultation want to charge me like $30 just to push a band on me instead of actual helping. Do you guys know of any other places I can go to or would I have just better luck setting up a dermatologist appointment? 
Last question I bought a brush cleaning board I guess that's what it is but what type of cleaner should I use to clean my makeup brushes?"

I’m kinda just starting out and so I’m wondering how my routine should go. (base)

should I use a hydrating or a matte primer?

(I think one is water based and silicone based? not sure though).

L’Oréal infallible Fresh wear foundation or my Colorpop tinted moisturizer.

I then powder with coty airpsun. 
I try not to do my whole entire face because it makes me look very dry. I just pat shiny areas. (that’d get up getting shiner later (sigh)

and then I don’t even know what setting spray to use?
a dewy hydrating one or a matte one?

I do prefer a matte look though because I don’t like my face feeling shiny.

1609559594,Makeup,Is it impossible for foundation to look good with acne scars?,"TLDR; Foundation separates on me the second I apply it and I’ve tried every trick in the book. Could high end foundation help? Or is it something else? 


I’ve recently started being a bit more insecure about my skin (It’s exam season and the stress is wreaking havoc) so I’ve been trying to wear foundation more. The only foundations I’ve tried are Maybelline Superstay, another random Maybelline one and a Clinique one when I was younger. 

My problem is, my foundation separates really badly around any fresh acne scars and on my forehead. I have normal-dry skin and I’ve tried priming and moisturising beforehand, or using a heavy night cream the night before. I’ve tried mixing oil into my foundation, I’ve tried brushes and sponges, and I exfoliate weekly with the Paula’s choice BHA (anymore and my skin gets too dry and peels). It looks the worst on my forehead even though I don’t have any active acne there but it looks incredibly cakey and separates horribly. It’s not even a case of it looking bad after a few hours, I can spend several minutes blending but it will look terrible straight away. 

I’m wondering if this is just a case of drugstore foundation not working so I bought the Nars sheer glow yesterday to see if that might make a difference but I’m not very hopeful. Could there be something I’m missing?"

A good grooming regimen can be exhausting, but until you guys get the hint, it keeps repeating. Finding a few of the right products and then actually using ’em is always a solid move, an investment in your personal appearance well-worth the effort involved. Proper beard care requires a little extra grooming and maintenance, and that means using [good quality products like beard shampoos and conditioners](https://www.styleinmood.com/10-best-beard-shampoos-and-conditioners-for-men-in-2021/). After all, keeping a clean beard is critical to growing long, full facial hair.

If you’re lucky enough to have a chin equipped with luscious, thick hair, you’ll also need to put the effort in to keep it clean. Since beard hair is thicker than regular hair, regular shampoo simply won’t do."

I was near finishing off my bottle of the foundation and the pump was no longer releasing any product. So, I unscrewed the cap so I could pour out some of the remainder into my hand. 
Something hard and jagged tumbled down toward the opening as I tried to pour some product out. I was mortified to see that it was a large piece of glass! Shards of glass were even on my fingers mixed in with the foundation. I had been using it like this for the past several months! I think I may have found the culprit for what is causing my cheeks to be rough these past few months. I'm horrified to think I was rubbing tiny glass shards into my face.. 

I wasn't sure if I need to contact Juice Beauty or Ulta about this. Who do you think is to blame? Has anyone experienced something like this? 

I figured Juice Beauty was to blame; I suspect it must have happened during manufacturing. I have no clue how a break in the glass could possibly occur in the inside. The bottle looks perfectly intact on the outside. I saved the container with the jagged piece of glass still in it for evidence. I'm shocked a product with such a defect could be put on the shelf!!

1609633696,Makeup,[Review] Natasha Denona - Tropic Palette Review,"✅ New Saturday Palette Review 

Natasha Denona - Tropic Palette ✌

👁 Look Created: Full Cut-Crease (look is in profile if you wanted to see it)

⚫ Packaging: each pan sizes is 1.5g, azure-blue hard plastic packaging, magnetic closure, medium rectangle shape, mirror inside, pans are removable from the back, shade names are printed below each shadow

⚫ Country of Origin: Italy

⚫ # of Shades in Palette: 15

⚫ Formulas Included: 4 formulas (10 creamy mattes, 3 sparkling, 1 metallics, 1 duochrome)

⚫ Designation: warm-toned neutral meets a pop of vibrancy

⚫ Type of Press: moderate-press - lots of kickback in pan, slight fallout on my face

⚫ Extra Information: paraben-free, each vertical row was designed to be a specific 'look', cruelty-free, limited edition from Spring/Summer 2018

💰 Price: $129.00
💲 Price/Shadow: $8.60

🔎 Review: This palette is so fun, because you can do an everyday 'neutral' look, or kick it up a notch with some color. For me, everything performed SO well - there was 0 patchiness with any shades that I used. The blendability between shades was amazing, and very, very easy. I did have some fallout, particularly from 'Laguna', but none of the neutrals. I really like the shade variance in this palette- you have a nice array of light, mid, and deep tones to create a full depth look. I actually really like this palette, and if you have it - recommend it for daily wear or a special event.

 I am at a loss and am so, so, so very tired of spending $30+ per  bottle of foundation that just doesn't work. I am about to move onto my 4th try of expensive foundation and would rather spend money like that on better things (like shoes....or ya know....bills lol)

I have acne prone/ scarred/ textured/mostly oily with a little bit of dry skin. Each morning I cleanse, moisturize, give time for moisturizer to dry, then prime before foundation. I let the primer set for 5+ min (however long it takes me to brush teeth and deal with my hair) before foundation, let set for a few minutes before setting powder. I use products for combination skin and am scared to use ones for dry skin. 

By the end of the day my foundation settles into my scars, leaving these little light flakey patches. No matter what foundation I've used, 2 faced born this way, urban decay, benefit hello happy, each one does this. The only foundation that has truly matched my skin the best has been the benefit hello happy, but its been the WORST with the dry flakey patches and cakes up so mush in my smile lines (I'm 30, its a thing, they exist, and I'm just *thrilled* they're there)

I'm super frustrated and just need to know what to do. Last time I was in ulta, I explained all of this to the girl working there, she recommended benefit hello happy....again best color match WORST one I've used yet, it basically settles in the scars but slides right off everywhere else.

I have huuuge eyes and not much for eyebrows -- I used to compulsively pick at them, just assume they're gone. When i paint them on, I know I don't go big enough, but I can't seem to get that right either.

Dark eyeshadow feels weird on me but it could just be a comfort zone thing. I am very very pale, with either cool or neutral skin tone, and my eyes are this weird shade of blue. Like dark blue, think of a standard blue crayola marker -- that's me. I'd like them if I knew WTF to do with them without looking like a maniac. Greys and Blacks either look very bad on me or I am very bad at them. Browns hit or miss it seems.

Should I give up on fun eyeshadow? Does anyone have any advice on making prominent/giant eyes look smaller?

With LRP I actually feel good/pretty confident, natural and I'm not immediately oily like I used to look with Fenty pro filtr matte. But i do miss Fenty's ability to hide my bad days which LRP cant. Any suggestions? I know it requires some trail and error but I'd like to avoid wasting lots of money."

I use a vitamin C serum as well. I’m wondering if anyone has any advice for how to treat these fine lines, AND how to stop them from showing when I do my makeup.

I always thought they were the same thing but they actually aren't. the most popular base I've seen is the PLouise eye base but the shipping to Canada is insane for me and I can't figure out how the color system for eye bases works. I've been using some random concealer that I found as an eye base and it works well, but then I read that conclear doesn't work well as an eye base.  but I also read that using a mattifying concealer makes a good eye base as you won't have to set it with powder or anything. another good eye base I've seen is the urban decay one. any thoughts on that? and also the ABH eye base, but I have read that it doesn't spread easily, dries up because you can get to work and eyeshadow still cracks anyway. I also recently purchase the elf 16 hr camo concealer because read that it works as a good eyeshadow base because it is matte 

so basically I need a good eye base: here are some that I've seen that are worth so drop your opinions on them:

\-plouise eye base

\-urban decay eye base

\-ABH eye primer

\-Covergirl eye primer

if you can make out the ten questions I asked, as a tip my skin is on the darker side. drop your opinion on these eyeshadow bases and any others that you would recommend."

1609877568,Makeup,Foundation allergy????,"Hey! So I love makeup. How it looks, the artistic processes, etc

I’ve tried on and off for years to start, but every time I do I have.... problems. I don’t know if it’s an allergy or if there’s just something wrong with me, but all of the foundations I have ever tried cause issues. I’ve had so many people try to tell me it can’t possible be the makeup, but the foundation is the only common factor in these incidents.

- Sinus headaches (yes, I’m positive it’s related to the foundation. Yes I’m positive it’s my sinuses. Yes it lasts the whole time and several hours, if not a whole day, later)

- Runny nose

- Watery, red eyes

- Puffy skin

- Sinus inflammation (Yes I’m sure.)

- Oil. Like a lot. Like it feels like the makeup is melting.

- For the next several days up to a week after I stop my skin will go through a bizarre cycle involving serious dryness, ridiculous oil production, redness, sensitivity, and shininess, before coming back to normal.

The sinus headaches, inflammation, and melting feeling are what people try to tell me “can’t possibly be the makeup” and “is all in my head”. I get these headaches when wearing foundation and when I have a sinus infection. Yes I’m positive that I have not coincidentally been sick every single time I’ve worn foundation since fourth grade up through now, in my 20s. I’m 99% sure I should not feel like Clinique and MAC are melting off my face, even in liquid form. Even the powdered ones felt like that to some extent. Maybe it’s the oil production?

I like how I look and get hyped and confident and then I can’t even enjoy it for more than a couple hours because I feel miserable. I want to look nice and feel pretty, but not at such a high cost of comfort.

I’ve tried liquid, cream stick, and powder. 

I’ve tried many different brands, admittedly a few “drugstore” ones, but I’ve also tried M.A.C., L’Oréal, and Clinique. People keep pointing me towards Clinique because it’s good for sensitive skin, but if it’s an allergy does that matter?

“Maybe it’s the eyeshadow?” “The mascara!”

Nope. I don’t have a mica allergy. I rarely wear mascara even when doing makeup, and when I do it by itself it’s fine. Same for the eyeshadow. Lipstick, lipgloss, and blush too. Color corrector felt fine the one time I tried it, up until I put the foundation on. Eyeliner. Lip liner. Liquid cream pencil powder. Shiny glittery matte waterproof not waterproof. All of it’s fine!

And finally, I’ve tried wearing nothing but foundation. That causes problems. Every time. It’s always the foundation. I’m sick of it.

I recognize that I may just... not be able to wear foundation if this is the case without discomfort. Which sucks. But I’m just not SURE, and I don’t want to give up, but I don’t want to waste money on brands that will keep producing these results.

Makeup store employees consistently try to tell me I’m full of shit, sell me the things I said I’ve tried, and lo and behold it happens again every single time.

So is it an allergy or sensitivity? Should I give up? Do I just need to suck it up and play roulette until I find a brand, or just accept that discomfort is probably going to be consistent no matter what I do?

I’m sorry if this is a weird question, I just don’t know where else to go. Dermatologist was completely unhelpful. Thank you to anyone who reads or has any advice!"

It’s either too orange, grey, yellow or the formula isn’t good. I also feel like it’s making me look more oily sometimes. It’s getting difficult and I’m spending so so so much money trying to find something that isn’t working for me. 

for example I have have tried and didn’t like:
Missha #13, Nyx Skin veil, Pixi h20 skin tint (cream), Nars (the lightest shade), Bare Minerals Complexion Rescue (Opal), Covergirl CG smoothers (lightest shade), Maybelline BB cream (light), Tarte amazonian clay BB tinted moisturizer (lightest shade again I think Ivory) It cosmetics CC cream (lightest shade), Covergirl skin milk, and Colorpop Tinted Moisturizer (fair 1N) literally the only one I’ve really liked is Glossier skin tint in (G12) but that’s like non existent coverage lol

I don’t do my makeup that often anymore and I only really need light-medium coverage. I like looking more natural and don’t like the heavy feeling that foundation has. 

I’ve also tried only concealer too but it looks too patchy and dry :/

I picked up the new Fenty powder foundation.. figured I'd give the brand another shot and since I don't know a damn thing about this formulation it seemed a good enough place as any to start.

I did a little test run a few hours ago, using the included sponge applicator. No primer because I wanna see how it does on its own. The color match is spot-on (a rarity for my super-cool medium-light complexion) so that's good. I realized, though, I don't have a metric to judge this by.

I use Maybelline matte primer, and currently Maybelline mousse foundation. I don't hate it but I know there's better, its still thicker than I want. 

I always put a layer of airspun powder over my foundation as well as nyx setting spray.

I tried it out and I do really like how hydrating it is! It beat a lot of other concealers I’ve tried and it didn’t crease or emphasize any dry matches, but I was really sad that it didn’t match my face. It looked okay in the mirror in some lightings but overall when I went into natural lighting. it didn’t match my fair skin at all. :(

I’ve tried maybelline age rewind (hate it) and maybelline fit me concealer in the lightest shade 
(this does not blend well at all) and they both don’t work 

I’m currently on the lookout for another hydrating concealer that runs in lighter shades ! 😁😅   

any help would be great :)"

👉 One/Size Ultimate Setting Powder 

First-Impression Review: The packaging makes it really hard to get enough powder into the lid. The shade 'transluscent' gives a white-cast to the face. The powder itself feels very nice, very finely milled. 

➡️ Shade: Transluscent
💰 Price: $30
🚦 Rating: C

👉 Milani Cheek Kiss Cream Blush 

First-Impression Review: I applied this with a damp sponge, &amp; then blended it out with a stippling brush. The color is SUPER pigmented, but it blends with ease. It applies over a set face just perfectly.

💰 Price: $9 
🚦 Rating: A

👉 Found Baked Bronzing Powder 

First-Impression Review: If you like a little shimmer in your bronzer, THIS is for you. I was a little apprehensive that it was going to be too light - but the shade was perfection on my skintone. No patchiness or skipping. Solid color with a nice sheen. 

➡️ Shade: 50 Golden Bronze
💰 Price: $7 
🚦 Rating: A

👉 Hourglass Arch Brow Sculpting Pencil 

First-Impression Review: I've always wanted to try this product. I was disappointed that you get SO little product in the tube. The tip makes application a breeze, and the formula is superb for a nice, sculpted brow. Not too waxy, but just enough for easy brush-through.

➡️ Shade: Blonde
💰 Price: $28

👉 KVD Vegan Beauty 'Edge of Reality' Palette 

First-Impression Review: There is something different about this formula, &amp; it is AMAZING. I love the entire recyclable aspect of this palette, &amp; I didn't have ANY issues blending the shades. The shimmers were intense with just a dry eBay brush! 

💰 Price: $30
🚦 Rating: A

👉 Essence Velvet Matte Lipstick 

First-Impression Review: I (for sure) thought these were going to be horrible, but they are HONESTLY probably the MOST impressive lipstick formula I've ever tried. They are SUPER creamy, not dry at all, evenly pigmented, &amp; smell great. Plus, they are super cheap and accessible!

1606920243,Makeup,Favorite lipstick formula and why? bullet? mega matte? liquid lip? gloss?,"Just curious what type of lip products people favor in this community. I personally really enjoy the liquid lips that don't dry all the way down into the stay-on-forever types, like the old Bite Beauty Amuse Bouche liquefied lip ones, and i have a set of Smashbox ones that I like a lot. I think they wear nicely, but my only complaint is they do get on my teeth sometimes and I have to be very vigilante about that when I first put them on. No idea how they travel so much, but I usually wear them as more of a stain so it's not a huge deal. 

Second is bullet lipsticks, but some brands leave a sort of film on my inner lips after wearing them for a long time and I am not sure what that is about. Again I liked Bite's bullets before reformulation (I'm not talking shit- I just haven't tried their new ones yet), along with Urban Decay Vice, Bare Minerals and Tarte. 

I love holiday mini sets because it's so rare I ever get to the end of any products except the basics like mascara, so minis are my jam because I get to try them out without dropping $20 per lippie if I don't like it."

I've told her no, and explained why, but said that if she can show to all of us (Mom, Dad, Step-dad, and me) that she's responsible enough for this kind of privilege, we'd consider getting some for her.

She won't be wearing it out of the house or anything, and I'll be using this as an opportunity for her and me to spend some more time together and to kinds open that door for her and me to have a really good relationship moving forward into her teen years. (Our relationship is fine now, btw, I've known her since she was 6, I just know it's going to change as she changes and grows)

I'm looking for help finding a few brands that are on the cheaper side, since this will basically be play makeup, but are still a decent quality to not utterly ruin her skin. I do wear makeup pretty regularly, but I have a skin disease and have only ever had good reactions to more expensive brands, and I don't think we're quite ready for that.

For those wondering, she recently turned 10. I can understand how some see that as really young to start letting her wear makeup, but I'm gonna treat it as more of a dress-up thing right now. Again, she won't wear it out of the house, except maybe to the drive-thru for chicken nuggets.

I know it's been a couple years since the discontinuation of this foundation, but I started using the Maybelline air foam foundation since 2013 and fell in love! Even though it oxidizes, which I know is not favorable in the makeup community, for me, it turns really radiant and a dewy finish on me. Even after trying several other foundations now, I've learned this one really gives me a beautiful sheer airbrush like finish effect, and just really works with my skin color/blush/bronzer combo, and with my skin texture!

I have dry, acne prone skin, textured (sheer with buildable coverage, with dewy radiant finish really works for me here), with yellow/golden undertones (natural beige shade in maybelline if that helps). (something that doesn't clog the skin too much preferred as well, but desperate to try anything!)

I know I can still buy it on ebay/amazon and the likes, but I'm preparing for when those aren't an option anymore! Does anybody have any good dupes for this?

1606963520,Makeup,Mask brackets are a game-changer for protecting masks and lipstick,"My boyfriend's mom ordered a pack of ""mask brackets"" and gave me one to try. They are these reusable silicone insert ""guards"" you wear under your mask (around $10 for 5 of them on Amazon), and it makes breathing more comfortable since the mask isn't being sucked in and out as you breathe. 

A side benefit of the bracket is it keeps your lip makeup intact -- I was sad because I couldn't wear colored lip products since it would smear onto my mask, but now the bracket separates your lips from the mask and prevents smudging.

Just wanted to let y'all know!"

I have smooth skin, so I don't  wear foundation and all that. I only use foundation powder rarely bc i embraced my shiny skin that somehow looks like glass skin some call it? But I keep wiping this stupid oil off LOL. So my make up look if I were to go out and do the whole enchilada:

 🌒 Mascara

  ✨  Eyebrows

  ⚡️ Freckles

  ☄️  Lipstick/Lipgloss -well I'm not able to wear any this year since half of my face is covered by a mask now. But I really like juicy ruby reds to dark reds, soft pink lip gloss, 

  🌈  Highlighter

  ☀️  Light dusting of blush (soft pink)

  ☁️  Winged eyeliner (im learnin haha)

  🪐  Extra lashes (learning that too  😘 )

  ❄️ Maybe some colored contacts soon?

My aesthetic is usually in the innocent/natural bubble. Like an innocent deer, or a fluffy bunny uwu. 

I'm looking for any cool ideas or things to try out. I have a round face, dimples, I basically look like a kid already, for reference. I tried finding some ideas on google but no luck.

Any new colors I should try out? Any ideas?  😀  💁🏼   💄 I'd appreciate it  😄"
1606974037,Makeup,Rediscovered my love of powder foundation,"I live in NZ and we've just entered our summer season (yay!). As the weather has been warming up I've been struggling with my usual liquid foundations looking shiny and shitty by the end of the day; forehead shine, rubbing off everywhere, patchy and separating...yum (/s). No matter which one I tried, the same thing was happening. 

I was decluttering my second tier makeup drawer and saw a Chanel powder that I got ages ago and on a whim decided to try it out today instead of liquid and .... oh my. Let me tell you, my skin today has looked perfect. Absolutely perfect. All. Day. Long. Completely natural, no horrible forehead shine, no patchiness, just even complexion with a lovely satin like finish. I'm so happy. I had completely forgotten about how good powder foundation can be. I also used a Nars powder blush ontop and it looked amazing; I've struggled using it with liquid foundation before (for obvious reasons) but ontop of the powder is just perfect. So now I've demoted all my liquids to the second tier drawer and am all about powder this season! 

So all you powder foundation lovers, tell me which ones are your favorites? I used to love the Elizabeth Arden mineral one, but any others that are worth a try?"

1606982434,Makeup,And good sprays (either fixing or setting) that work with combination skin?,"Hello!

So I have combination skin, with my T-zone especially getting oily, and I've been looking for a very good spray, I especially have been looking at Mac Fix+ Matte (fixing spray) and Urban Decay All Nighter (setting spray), but I am still undecided and am still looking for that HG spray. 

For reference I also use High-Adherence Silicone Primer from The Ordinary and Mac Studio Fix SPF 15 and MAC Transparent Powder and use a really awful fixing spray that I bought from this unknown, no-name brand and it's a decision I really regret, cause it does nothing and only contains fragrance. I've been looking for a fixing spray, but I guess a setting spray can do the trick, as I'm looking for something that both sets my makeup and makes it last longer and won't make my face melt. I'm looking for an almighty spray haha.

1607096909,Makeup,Can we let women who want to wear makeup just be and let those who don’t just be without making a big humble bragging deal of how you “never wear makeup.” Here’s why.,"For many women makeup is an artistic expression and it’s also therapeutic, it may be the only 15 mins a mother has to herself in a day. I don’t think women need to wear makeup like they’re going on a photo shoot each day but if she’s more confident with some foundation etc, then there’s nothing wrong with it. Why do we shower and wash our hair, it makes us feel good. I’ve always had skin breakouts since my teens and I’m 33 and still do. It sucks because I’ve tried everything but still have to cover up skin tone damage. I do this because it makes me feel better to not have discolored skin visible to everybody. I’m also treated better by society by looking my best. It’s my routine just like applying moisturizer or keeping my hair nice and healthy. Nothing more annoying than beautiful skinned people who have never had a pimple brag how they “don’t wear makeup.” Good job. But please have some consideration for how you make women feel who do chronic have skin issues, and all we want is to not have them. It’s nothing to do with not having self esteem, I have plenty because I accept my flaws and imperfections and like anyone I do make the best of my situation by using quality makeup and a good skin care routine. I still get breakouts, and I can’t just put random junk on my face like other people who never have a reaction to anything. Rest assured if you ever had a patch of 5-6 pimples on your chin every month you would be covering them up too. Just because your skin genetics are better doesn’t give you the right to humble brag about “never wearing makeup” and indirectly shaming women who do. I’ve met women in their 30s with really bad acne and I see how it makes them feel. They wish they didn’t have that problem. But no they are not going to “be brave” and bare their flawless natural skin without blush because that’s not their reality. It’s sad and no one should be experiencing that in their 30s. So for women who love to brag about not wearing makeup, just put yourself in someone else’s shoes and shut up for once. You’re not better or more confident just because you have an even skin tone and others don’t. It is conceited if anything, for failing to support other women in their effort to put their best foot forward, even if that includes a makeup routine. Thanks."

They were sold in beauty supply stores as PermaBrow and Lip Techs. They were sold as two different products,  one for your lips the other for your brows, but could be used interchangeably. They came in a tube, with a nailpolish type soft brush inside. The liquid inside was clear. The point of these products was to brush the product on top of your freshly applied lips or eyebrows, let it dry for a minute or two, and your eyebrows or lipstick ( regardless of color, brand or how cheap the makeup you applied was), would stay on for 24 hours, even if you went swimming. These products were amazing,  they truly worked and were waterproof. Your lipstick or eyebrows WOULD NOT COME OFF in the water. The only thing that would take it off after applying Lip Techs or Permabrow was scrubbing with soap and water. As these products could he used interchangeably, I found the Liptechs to be slightly better than Permabrow, but both were awesome.

Does anyone know what happened to them? I'm pretty sure they went out of business.  Google searching returns nothing,  although I might be spelling them a bit differently. It's been years since I've used these, so it's hard to remember the correct spelling.
But more importantly,  if they are out of business,  where can I find a clear, brush on over makeup product just like this for lips and eyebrows that is also awesome?

Please help.

I dont want something to put on **under** the lipstick  but I need something that won't break it down (act as a solvent) on top because it just looks too parched.

It's the only lipstick I use (don't want to switch brands) because it is so pigmented  and I have two unusual colors I live in.  I just need something to put on top so it doesn't look so crazy dry.

One reason I wear it is it doesn't seep into the fine lines around my mouth so I do not want anything with solvent properties for this product.

THANKS!!!!!"
1607224933,Makeup,Lashes for hooded lids/small eyes?,"So for reference, I have hooded lids, small/downturned eyes, and small lid space. My natural lashes are also very naturally curled and right up against my lids practically. I love false lashes, just most don’t work on me. I think the issue is how little space I have between the lash line and my eyebrows, as well as not having much space between my lash line and my lid, and because of this, most lashes are usually just too long and look absolutely ridiculous on me. I recently went and grabbed Kiss “looks so natural” lashes from Walmart as I needed something quick for a special occasion, and they definitely did not look natural on me. They were touching my eyebrows and just didn’t look right 😆 anyone have any suggestions for lashes that’ll work? Drugstore or high-end, doesn’t matter"

1607226514,Makeup,Is there like a vocab list for makeup?,"Hi, so I'm 20 and I rarely wear makeup. Growing up, my mom kinda discouraged it and what she did teach me, I'm realizing might have been wrong.

For example, I thought concealer and liquid foundation were the same thing.

The thing is, I think makeup is interesting from an artistic perspective and I'd like to learn a bit about it so I can experiment.

I tried to watch some beauty tutorials but YouTubers assume I already know the basics, like what the different liquids and powders are and how to use them in general.


Given the info below on what I do and don't know, so you have any articles or videos y'all recommend? Or general advice? I'm sorry this is so long.


*Here are the things I've heard of but don't know:*
*beauty blender
*primer
*bronzer
*bb cream
*toner (since when are we printers? lol)

*Here are the words I do know:*
*mascara
*false eyelashes
*eyelash curler
*brush
*sponge
*blush
*foundation
*concealer
*lip liner/lip gloss/lipstick
*tweezers

*And here are my questions:*
*Is there a difference between moisturizer and lotion?
*I know what matte means from an art perspective, so what is the alternative option called? Glossy?
*What the hell is ""cutting the crease""?
*Where _are_ you supposed to use concealer for?
*What is the name of that green stuff that people use to make their skin less red? How does it work?
*Why use eyebrow pencils vs powders? Or are you supposed to use both?
*How do you apply false eyelashes? Does the glue go on the eye or the lash? How would you know what they look like on you before buying them?
*Are you supposed to apply makeup with the same hand on both sides or do you switch hands?
*Does makeup expire? What are the risks of using old makeup?
*Why are there so many types of brushes and what are the different shapes for? I think I'm using them wrong cuz I approach makeup like painting because that's my only basis.
*How do you figure out your foundation color to buy online? *Why would people use liquid vs powder foundation?
*Why do people use setting powder vs spray? Is this only supposed to keep the powdery parts on or does it also protect the parts like eyeliner and mascara?
*How do you use an eyelash curler?
*How do you keep makeup from rubbing off on clothing or furniture?
*What things should be applied with a sponge vs a brush vs a finger?
*What do you call the little brush people use on their eyebrows? What is it for??
*Why can't I seem to get blush to show up on my face? It looks really pink in the container and I put a lot on the brush but it won't stick to my cheeks!
*How are people able to cover acne without risking bacterial infections?"

1607236843,Makeup,Why do all blushes pull warm on me?,"Maybe this is an inane question, but I'm curious. FYI, I am fair with olive undertones. I think I lie somewhere between neutral and yellow.

I've recently noticed that all my blushes pull warm on me. While I generally prefer peachy and brown-ish shades (Luminoso from Milani and the old formulation of Rose Champagne from Wet n' Wild are favorites), I've noticed that cooler blushes also blend into a peachy-warm shade on me. Plum Rose from Physician's Formula, Paaarty from Tarte, and Dolce Pink from Milani all do this. 

This isn't due to dirty brushes, and I'm not sure if it's due to my undertones. Cool-toned eyeshadows, highlighters, and lipsticks all stay true-to-color on me, but blushes do not. I was wondering if anyone had any insight; I'm a little sick of peachy cheeks no matter which blush I wear."

I have also tried a neutral foundations and that looks ""frosty"" and a little purple-ish on my neck, but my sister said she thinks it ""ties in my face and neck together"".

Of course I have mascara, foundation, eyeliner (liquid), concealer, highlighter, and all the other make up stuff but honestly I just hoard them and never got to put them on use because I just don’t know how to put them on properly.

What's the best eyebrow pencil/gel/pomade that can get a natural look and not slide off my face? I have pretty oily skin (that could change during chemo, but idk). I'm a redhead, so I'm not very experienced with heavy eyebrow makeup. 

As for lashes, will falsies even stick if I don't have real eyelashes to help hold them up? Are there any great glue options for that? 

Also I know you can't really give advice about my specific skin tone, but what's a makeup brand that's well-known for accurate color matching? I use MAC studio powder now, and it's not exactly right. I want to be able to wear makeup without having to put it all over my head.

1607421761,Makeup,Effective mascara for sore peepers,"I am looking for recommendations for good mascara for irritable eyes, available in the UK. I had Lasik a couple of years ago and ever since, the mascara I used to use makes my eyes feel gritty. 

Recently, I bought a mascara for sensitive eyes from Amazon, and it's non-irritating, but it doesn't **do** much! (Bell - Hypoallergenic, Long &amp; Volume).

Previously I used Doll10 shiny pink one (I forget the name, but it was really good), or Benefit spiky end one (apparently, names aren't my strong point). Generally I prefer a silicone/plastic applicator rather than a traditional brush, but am very willing to give anything a go.

1607424360,Makeup,Can't tell if my Too Faced palette is fake or not,"As the Too Faced Watermelon Slice isn't available in the UK, I decided to buy it off eBay for a semi decent price. (Yes i know bad idea but I cannot get it anywhere) The quality of it is very good, the makeup guide is high quality (that slippy yet sticky paper which feels good to touch) and even the palette has the same feel as the Life's a Festival palette (which I own and is definitely real). The pigmentation is pretty good bar the shimmers, which have been reported to be like glitters rather than shimmers, only problem is the black stained my arm when swatching. The packaging has all the seed indentations, the gold is right. It feels right. It also SMELLS a bit melony.  A bit like the cucumber face mist smell and it's pretty strong. The only problem is the serial numbers, which can be a big give away. On the box it says A89 and on both slices of the palette it says B69 which is weird. Any ideas? If it's fake I'm not disappointed. I didn't spend a lot and it is what it is."

1607573196,Makeup,Tips and tricks for those with dry skin/eyelids,"I have eczema and I struggle badly on my face. Because I constantly monitor it, it's never too bad, but sometimes I can't prevent dryness and that's usually on my eyelids. They're often red, irritated and hurt. They also make me super sleepy because it hurts to keep them open. In the meantime, I've just applied moisturiser twice a day but that usually doesn't help. They always stay bad. There's been times where I've taken a full face of make up of because my eyelids were too dry for eyeshadow. I had given up.

That was until today. My sister and I went into Tkmaxx to have a look around and we walked over to the skincare aisle as my sister is super interested in it. I've never liked skincare because having eczema, 9 times out of 10 it ends up making my skin worse. However, today I found myself drawn to the [Tonymoly Kitty Eye Contour Stick](https://tonymoly.us/products/cats-purrfect-eye-contour-stick) and the [Tonymoly Whale Eye Cream](https://tonymoly.us/products/moisture-boost-cooling-eye-serum). I heard of a website recently called [Skin Sort](https://skinsort.com/ingredient-analyzer) which have an analyser to tell you if a certain product would help your skin or not. I tried it on the products in the shop and the whale seemed really good. The cat one wasn't good for eczema but for some reason I thought screw it and went for it. 

I'm so glad I did. My eyelids are so soft and gentle. They feel nice. Silky smooth, but not sticky and they've been like this for hours now. They're the best purchase I've ever made.

My tips and tricks are:
- Use Skin Sort!  It tells you if it's best for your skin or not and can give you an estimate of of it's worth it.
- If you suffer from dry eyelids like me, please try this. I hope it does the same for you. Admittedly, my eyes burned a tiny bit when I put the eye cream on, but it instantly stopped and hasn't burned since (my eyelids were just irritated)."

1607644429,Makeup,"I’ve never done a full face of makeup, any help with learning where to start?","So I haven’t worn any makeup in the last 2 years, before that I would only wear foundation and a bit of mascara. Literally the only reason I used to wear makeup was to hide the terrible acne I had, and I sort of just stopped wearing makeup after I got rid of the acne. 
But I have some events coming up soon and I’d like to be able to wear some makeup for those and just learn it in general as I have no clue haha 
So my question is what makeup would you suggest wearing e.g. is bronzer, primers, highlighters necessary etc? 
I also will only be buying vegan and cruelty free makeup, so any brand or product suggestions would be amazing, and any suggestions for false lashes as well.
Should I go with a liquid or powder foundation, which is better for acne prone skin? 
I have no idea if I have cool or warm tone skin, is there like an easy way to tell that? (Other than what colour your veins are) 
Thank you in advance!"

1607652557,Makeup,Eyeliner for super watery eyes?,"Any time I'm putting eyeliner on, my eyes will tear up a decent amount. Not to the point where tears are running down my face or get in the way of applying it, but they do water. I like applying eyeliner on my top lash line to make them look fuller, but since my eyes water while applying it and generally throughout the day, it transfers to my lower lash line. The transferring is a bigger issue than anything. I use drug store make up, so I might have to look for something a little more expensive. 

I'd still like for it to be decently ""affordable"", but does anyone have any recommendations for an eyeliner (pencil, crayon, whatever you call it) that won't transfer from my upper lash line to my lower lash line?"
1607652904,Makeup,Advice with makeup around the mouth area?,"Sorry if these questions has been asked before I'm new here!! 

I just got home from work and looked in the mirror... I got a shock what I looked like!! Bc I smiled a lot today I saw I had big crease lines where my smile would be!! So embarrassing, I don't have any wrinkles yet, but man, I look like I did after my makeup creased around my mouth. 
How do I stop creasing in that area? I set my makeup with power and use a finishing spray. What else can I do?

The makeup on under eyes never creases for some reason my mouth is my problem area. I loose makeup pretty fast in that area in general. My foundation always comes off round my mouth idk why? Also thats where I noticed I had creases today, between my cheeks. Embarrassed I walked around like a hot mess omgg.. I had no idea. 

I'm by no means a makeup expert either, I just average knowledge so sorry if this is a dumb question. Anyone have any tips for these 2 problems?"

I have been using Tarte Shape Tape in Fair Neutral, but when my skin gets dry in the winter, it gets cakey, even when I'm moisturized. Curious if anyone has suggestions for sensitive skin that gets dry in the winter but is normal during the rest of the year. Something that will covering acne scars and redness, but will allow my freckles to shine through, I guess buildable?

1607708980,Makeup,My foundation literally never matches. I just want ONE thing that looks good on me and I'll be happy,"I tried asking this in /r/OliveMUA but the automod clearly hates me lmao

After lurking around a few forums and blogs dedicated to (tan) olive skin, I've narrowed down my foundation search to about ten foundations that I think are in my shade range. I can't figure it out for the life of me, but every neutral/olive or warm shade I've picked up has looked strangely pink on me?? Even NARS Sheer Matte/Sheer Glow in Stromboli, which was like THE olive/yellow foundation pulls pink on me.

So far I've owned:

* NARS Sheer Glow - Stromboli (orangey-pink and very slightly too light)
* Fenty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte - 290 (this pulls more orangey-brown on me)
* Too Faced Born This Way - Golden Beige (very slightly too light and pinky-brown on me)
* Colourpop Pretty Fresh Tinted Moisturizer - Medium 12W (the depth is perfect but too pink)
* NYX Total Control Drop Foundation - Beige (ashy orange; Medium Olive was too light)
* Maybelline Fit Me Dewy + Smooth - 220 Natural Beige (perfect depth but pinky-brown on me)
* Uoma Beauty Say What!? Foundation - Honey Honey T2N (too pinky-brown), T2W (too orangey-brown), and T2C (WAY too pink)

I feel like with this pattern I should understand what my problem is but I'm still clueless."

I place a lot of lid product with my fingers anyways, but for everything else what I’m using just isn’t working for me at this point. 

I need some that place product well, blend well, allow for precision, and if possible help reduce product fallout (if possible lol). This is why I’m looking for sets if possible to find them and need some recommendations! 
 
Personally I’m absolutely willing to spend a decent amount of money to find some good quality brushes that work well and last over time, looking to see if you guys know what brands to look into and brands you personally find great. I live in Canada so I assume a lot of them would be available to order to here!

For my mascara, I use one coat of the Benefit bad gal and them a coat of the thrive mascara. The benefit mascara gives me lots of definition and the thrive makes my lashes thicker and longer. I find if I just use the thrive, I don’t get as many lashes. It’s an expensive combo however!

But the problem is that the palette itself is only 22$, so I decided I'll save up some money until the sales come up, and I don't know which sale I should wait for: the Black Friday one or the Christmas one?

Which one should I wait for? Which one would be worth it? And what else from the collection or Colourpop in general should I take a look at? 

I'm also from Europe and I've heard shipping is quite the problem, but idk, I'm willing to risk it all, especially if it's gonna be my first order from them.

If you have suggestions, tips or help I'll be happy to hear them out.

Thanks and peace!! :)"
1604492092,Makeup,Magnetic Lashes?,"I’m in a wedding party next month, located in a hot and humid country. I’m lucky that I don’t have to wear a lot of makeup that will melt off, and would like to wear magnetic lashes. 

I was hoping anyone would have any recommendations on an easy-to-apply, non-damaging magnetic lash. I’ve read Ardell makes a decent one, but those reviews could be paid-for, and I’d rather ask real people. 

I would definitely practice application at home prior to, and would like to get it ASAP so I can get comfortable.

I feel like I could use it for skincare too but the fan fave one has a sponge as well (I don't really use sponges so is the real technique one like a holy grail?). I really love the color pink so that's really making me lean towards the brush set lol!

1604756201,Makeup,Advice for someone who looks better with no makeup? (But still wants to wear makeup),"Hi guys! So lately I have been wearing Kardashian-inspired makeup (full coverage foundation, baking, contour, fake eyelashes etc). It’s great, it’s fun (although time-consuming) and it looks nice in pics when I want to give off a “bad b***h” vibe lol. But my mum says I look better without heavy makeup. She says it makes me look older, dirtier (probably because of the bronzer) and does not suit me.

I didn’t wear fake eyelashes for the first time in front of my boyfriend today and he said he was “blown away by my natural beauty” and to “please not wear fake eyelashes around him anymore”. The last two bfs I had before him also said the same things but I never believed them because I had always been insecure about my natural eyes.

Anyways idc what men think. It was my mum’s comments that got me doing a double take because I know she wants the best for me and wouldn’t lie to me. A lot of mistakes were made in my youth because I didn’t listen/trust/follow her advice lol.

So I took pictures of myself without any makeup and compared it next to pictures of myself with makeup and I have to say she’s right - I look better without makeup. It’s not even the age thing, but my skin is more glowy and “clean”, my features aren’t exaggerated/convulted and everything hits the eye right. While I thought I was hot sh*t when taking the makeup pics, having now compared it to myself with no makeup, in the makeup ones I now realise I look like a 6 year old trying to look 45 :S Idk if I’ll go as far to say that it doesn’t suit me, but it is a different look.

Anyways I don’t want to give up makeup! I just want to change my routine to achieve a more natural, glowy look. I’ve read that BB creams and powder foundations are good for that? And “no highlighter highlighters” Also I still want to contour my nose and jawline."
1604762435,Makeup,Foundation and concealer with multiple skincare concerns?,"I haven't been able to find foundation or concealer don't actually make my skin look worse. My self confidence is in the gutter and I'm looking for recommendations. I don't expect my skin to look flawless or anywhere close, I just don't want it to look worse that it does bare-faced.

My current skincare issues:
- Hormonal acne (cheeks and chin)
- Acne scarring (also some pitting)
- Dry patches around nose and cheeks
- Fine lines (27F; a little under my eyes, on my forehead, and around my mouth, nothing major but it looks so much worse with bad foundation)

Foundations I've tried:
- Bare Minerals BarePro Foundation: looked cakey, dull, and gross
- Rare Beauty: settled into fine lines, clung to dryness, overall the worst foundation I've ever had the misfortune of trying
- NARS Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer: just purchased, not tried yet

Concealers I've tried:
- It Bye Bye Under Eye Concealer: texture looked weird
- Rare Beauty Concealer: not as bad as the foundation, but didn't actually do much to conceal
- Sephora Clear and Cover Concealer: just purchased, not tried yet

I do have a decent skincare routine that has been helping and I'm working on drinking more water, but it's going to be a long time before my skin is back to where it was. In the meantime, I just want to be able to go to work without feeling like I look like a hag. Please help a girl out."

1604780477,Makeup,Should I wear makeup to work?,"Just to preface, I guess I'll start out by saying that knowing how to put on makeup isn't really an issue here. I just don't usually wear it that much since I grew out my eyebrows and found my breakthrough to clear up my skin. I like the way I look now, and I've gotten used to looking the same way when I wake up, while go about my day, and when I've just gotten out of the shower.

But I definitely have kind of a baby face, and my eyelashes and eyebrows are more of a lighter brown while my hair is super dark, almost black. Once again, I don't think I look bad without it, but it definitely makes me look my age when I darken my brows and put on mascara. Almost like a different person.

And mentally, it's just... weird trying to get used to. I used to be almost obsessive about makeup back in high school and it was super damaging to my confidence. Sometimes I still notice that tiny feeling of disgust come back now whenever I take off my makeup and see my real face again, even though on a normal day I like it just fine!

So I generally avoid it, and working as a student in one of my college's department offices now makes for a pretty low-key environment. But once I graduate, I'm planning on working in a similar field of marketing for a while in a more professional environment, where it might benefit me as a (married, by then) professional to look more like a woman and less like a kid.

I do dress well and clean up nice, but would going without makeup make me look less put-together?"
1604784875,Makeup,How do I get my stick straight eyelashes to stay curly,"I know how to curl my eyelashes so they look permed. But most mascaras just make my lashes flat again once it dries.

Any one with super flat lashes have any tips or mascara brands that actually works? 

(I cba with fake lashes and can't do a real perm due to an allergic reaction. And the heated curlers dont make a difference to me )

I'm so envious of people with even a slightly curl in there lashes 😖Thanks!!"

Have these problems actually been fixed? Would you recommend this palette? 

I love the color story, there is almost nothing else like it, and I think the theme is fun. If it weren't for those scandals I would have probably gotten it already."
1604869643,Makeup,"How do I wear eyeliner so that it doesn't make my eyes look thin and long, but rather ""rounder""?","I have a type of asian eyes, they're more ""almond"" shaped but I found that when I add a wing to my eyeliner, it makes my eyes look long and thin. I used to like this look, but lately I've been exploring more ""natural"" looks and I want to make my eyes look more round and awake. I have the thinnest double-eyelids, so they're basically mono-lids. 

I've also found that when I smile with eyeliner on, it makes it curve upwards in a weird way and I don't like it too much. 

How could I use eyeliner to make my eyes look bigger but not in a way that they look thin and longer? I was thinking about using a brown liner to draw the tiniest wing that follows my upper lid (so continuing downwards rather than upwards), would this work?"

Gently exfoliate your skin to promote new skin growth. Peels, especially those containing coarse grains, can sometimes be aggressive to the skin. The use of abrasive exfoliants can lead to skin blemish and scarring.

***Hydration***

Never underestimate the power of hydration. Moisturized skin retains its luminosity. It restores the pH of your skin, regenerates it, and gives it a fresh feeling."

This foundation makes my skin look so dry. It’s cakey and sets terribly no matter what. What makes me even more angry is the fact that when it dries outside the bottle, it is rock solid. (I can only imagine what it’s doing on my skin) It dried up and clogged the pump so every time I use it I have to unscrew the top and pour some out. And the WORST part that really put me over the edge was what I noticed today... it ruined my makeup brushes. When I went to wash my foundation brush, it was stuck together and rock hard in a lot of places. It couldn’t be salvaged. I’ve literally had that brush for 10 years with no issues.

1604934390,Makeup,Where do I start!?,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting on here. Sorry in advance for this being long, I’m just stuck and want to feel more pretty/confident.

Last night my boyfriend told me that my makeup doesn’t look good a lot of the time (which I agree with and have said to him multiple times). I’m 21 and rarely wear makeup since I don’t know how to do it, so my skill level is definitely a beginner. I’m NOT trying to get better at makeup because of his comment — I’d like to feel my age and more confident. :)

I’m very pale and scared of contour. I only use foundation, concealer, mascara, and blush. Should I be adding more? I don’t use setting spray or powder either! I don’t like heavy makeup and prefer a more natural look... but I’d like to not look like I didn’t put any effort into it, if that makes sense. Also, I have no idea how to put on falsies.

I think because I don’t know how to do a lot of this stuff, it makes me not want to do my makeup. 

Can anyone please give me tips on looking more “put together” and maybe push me in the right direction of videos or people that can help? (Hopefully that’s allowed?) I am 21 and look 15 — even with makeup! I would love to look my age but don’t know if any specific products would help or not."
1604935315,Makeup,Is using foundation with your makeup neccesary?,Hey everyone! So Ive been doing makeup since I was 12  and its almost been 6 years now. I used to use foundation and not heavy ones and it would cause me acne. So I stopped using for a while and my skin actually cleared up a lot . So I stopped using foundation completely. Now I do full glam looks and different eye makeups etc. Etc. But all I use now is mostly concealer for undereyes and sometimes not even that. Btw my skin color is quite consistent as well. However sometimes I cannot find that smoooooth ass matte look on my skin. Do you think my makeup is missing sth without foundation? Or it would still be as good as that with a clear and consistent skin? In a nutshell should i start using foundation again or like would it be unnecessary?

I have tried to use foundation matching tools to figure out which foundation I can go for, but they hardly have options for my foundation shade (NW58) and when they do, they appear too red.

If anyone on here is the same shade and has oily/combo skin, please share your favourite foundations with me. I want to start wearing makeup more often.

 In between moves I lost it, and I really miss it. Everyone I know is darker complected than I am, do none of their lipgloss works on me. I'll try to be as discriptive as possible.


 Smelled like cake

 Did not taste like cake

 It was a red shade with some sparkle to it

 It's an older lipgloss, I found it like 3-4 years ago

 It didn't feel tacky or sticky after I put on, it was pretty easy to apply as well as take off

 The body of the tube was red, not sure if it was just red, or if it was the gloss

 The top was black

1604990672,Makeup,An overly detailed review of my lip balms that nobody asked for,"I’m a sucker for tinted lip balms and just want to share an honest review of them, in case anyone has been eyeing something I have. I had a picture but apparently I can’t post, so 1- best  8- worst

1. Fresh sugar tinted lip balm (lip treatment? I don’t know, it’s the tube version). You either love it or hate it. Personally this is the most soft, thick, cushiony, moisturizing lip balm I’ve ever used. There are some pigmented ones but I got the sheer Rose and I only apply twice a day because it’s long lasting on the lips. Only problem is it runs out quickly because it’s so soft. It’s firm in colder weather, but don’t keep it in your pocket/car in the summer. Smells sugary and I love it. $24 sucks, but it’s what works best for my lips.

2. Burts bees tinted lip balm. This is an obvious staple for most people. It’s a classic, I’ve never seen a bad review. The price varies, i think I got it for $4-5. I can’t find my pomegranate shade but all the flavors smell and taste amazing. Thin and not sticky. For the price and easy application (no finger) it’s the best go-to. 

3. Vaseline lip therapy. This is different than regular vaseline, it doesn’t just sit on top of my lips. It is super smooth and long lasting, and moisturizing. Great for winter. Subtle color, basically a very cheap dupe for glossier’s BDC. I know it’s a drugstore product ($2) but it seriously does a better job than a lot of balms I’ve tried. It’s right up to par with burts bees, if anything it’s more moisturizing, but it SUCKS to use your finger to dig out the product, especially during a pandemic. It gets messy. It’s still second on my list though because it works so well, and you can’t beat that price. I’m interested in trying the pan version.

4. Glossier balm dotcom. Basically a glorified vaseline (the lip therapy is more moisturizing, imo). This is best for locking in moisture rather than providing it. (It does make your lips soft though). They all taste and smell amazing (except cherry, smells strongly of cough syrup). I found that Coconut and Rose are the most moisturizing, the others are more petroleum-y. The tinted ones are Cherry and Berry (maybe Fig too).  Berry is absolutely delicious. For $12 you can just stick to vaseline lip therapy, but this application is slightly easier, and there is twice as much product than the small vaseline tub. Choosing between those is up to you. I haven’t been reaching for anything that requires using my finger.

5. Dior lip glow. It would absolutely take the #3 spot but because of the price I had to knock it down ($34). I absolutely love this though, I have the shade Rosewood and it’s “your lips but better”. Not too pink like the original shade. it’s based on your pH so it varies on people. Its smooth and not sticky. It’s not the most moisturizing balm, but it does a fair amount of hydrating and the tint lasts the whole day, even when the balm wears off. It has a minty, vanilla floral smell, so good. I got this recently and I use it more than #3 and #4, truthfully. But because of the price I don’t think I can repurchase. 

6. Buxom plump lip balm. $18. Doesn’t plump my lips and is only slightly moisturizing. It’s minty but not really tingly. I use this more for the color, it’s also a pH lip balm and it gives me a nice pink that lasts a very long time. Like, I can eat an oily hamburger and it’ll still be there. If you’re scared the original will give you a hot pink color, go with the mauve or nude shade. I also love the shape because it’s big and round and easy to apply. On the contrary it is chunky and takes up space in my bag, no big deal though. 

7. Rare Beauty dewy lip balm $16. I got the clear shade Honor because the tinted ones are SERIOUSLY pigmented, and I can’t wear them under my mask. It has a medium level of moisture. Not sticky. I don’t know if it’s just the clear shade but the smell and taste is absolutely disgusting. I cannot bear it, I really want to love it but it’s the only balm that I smell and taste the entire time I’m wearing it. I avoid it sadly. You can almost smell the natural ingredients but this weird chemical smell overpowers it all. It also stops working where I can twist it up but not back down, so I have to push the product back down. I love the packaging though. Has a flat side and it’s matte, magnet top, easy to clean (not that I care). I won’t repurchase until they change the formula. 

8. Fresh sugar hydrating lip balm (pan version). This would be #7 because it smells and tastes nice but the pan application is annoying. Besides that, it’s $18 and isn’t long lasting or moisturizing at all. I feel like I have to keep reapplying it, but because there’s little product in the pan I can’t help but be stingy with it. It doesn’t make sense because I thought it’s pretty much the same as the tube version, but this is a thinner formula and just doesn’t really do anything for me. 

9. EOS lip balm. Anything eos, just no. Straight up wax that dries up my lips when the initial application wears off and it makes me reapply even more, leaving me in an endless waxy-dry-flaky cycle of application. Many people are addicted to this and I don’t get how it’s supposedly the best balm ever."

So, I've recently gone to a MAC store and got my foundation matched to NC15 and concealer to NC20 which leads me to wonder: that it either was a wrong match or the lady messed up the numbers. Now, the problem is that I've looked up both Temptalia and Findation's foundation matrixes and got matched to foundation leaning between NC25 and NC30, so right now I am baffled.

What should I do in this case? Previously I've used 123 Perfect Foundation by Bourjois in Light Beige, City Radiance again by Bourjois in Beige Doré and BB Cream by Dermacol in Fair (which was a wrong match back then because I was too young to know how shades and undertones worked). I also used some concealer from Deborah Milano in 2 and Secrets of Camouflage Concealer Palette from Deborah Milano.

I would really appreciate some input on this problem. Can I solve this only through trial and error?

Another option would be the shade Pioneer but it seems a bit too bright and I'm afraid it's gonna end up looking pink too. I can't even test it in the store since it's not allowed anymore so I have absolutely no idea if it's my dream red or another pink.

1605242625,Makeup,How to start getting into makeup,"I'm 13, almost 14, and I want to know how to start doing makeup I guess. I just don't really know where to start. My parents aren't really for or against it, I've tried wearing eyeliner and blush and they said I was ""too young"" and laughed, but on other occasions asked me if I wanted any makeup. This was usually around last year though, when I was going through the internalized misogyny phase of ""I'm better than other girls because I'm confident and don't have to wear makeup to be pretty."" Recently, I've been thinking about it and I would really like to learn how to start doing makeup/makeup art. I'm pretty ok at eyeliner I think, but I don't really know how to apply anything else/how to ask my parents to buy makeup for me. What products should I ask for, and where should I start?"

1605246012,Makeup,Help w/gift for melanin rich skin eyeshadow please!,"Hi. I am not super into makeup so I need some help please. I want to buy my best friend a present and since she loves makeup, I'd like to get her a nice eyeshadow pallett. She likes natural looks but sometimes I've seen her pull a glam. Not sure if it matters for eyeshadow but she's from the Dominican Republic and has darker skintone than me. I think one time she told me she's olive undertone but I can't remember exactly and don't really understand that whole undertone thing. Also her skin type tends to be on the more dry side cause shes always putting on heavier moisturizers (if that even matters for eyeshadow?). Any suggestions? 

My budget is around $30. Since I don't buy makeup that often I'm not sure if this is enough, so am willing to take suggestions out of this price range.

I also currently have no tools (like brushes), so some recommendations on them maybe nice too. I'm just looking for some stuff to get as a good starting point.

1601753752,Makeup,How to do the sun kissed makeup look for medium to darker skin tones?,My foundation is a NC42 in MAC. I have medium-deep skin with olive undertones (I’m south asian). I love the sun kissed look- glowy bronzer and blush look with minimal eye makeup. I want to achieve this look but when I add blush across my nose or more on my cheekbones I end up looking like a clown (I use the milk makeup cream blush stick) so I do it very subtly but it doesn’t have that sun kissed effect. I don’t use bronzer too much—does anyone have recommendations for a bronzer for medium skin? I mostly contour. What else can I do to achieve this look? Do I use eyeliner (usually just use mascara)? I’m not a fan of glitter so I don’t use highlighter. I almost always use a setting powder so often times I look Matte. I have combination skin.

1601761512,Makeup,My boyfriend is upset I want to return the makeup his mother got for me,"This is honestly so stupid and I’m probably being dramatic but I want to vent, sorry if it’s long or if this doesn’t belong in this sub, it’s my first real Reddit post. 
So I’m not a big makeup user, I only use SPECIFIC mascara, concealer, and tinted lip balm from one brand, foundation breaks out my skin, lipstick makes my lips bleed and crack, my boyfriend knows all this. 
I told him a week ago I’m interested in Selena’s new brand Rare Beauty and that I’m going to hold off on buying because I don’t wear makeup right now, especially lipstick, because masks. Well my birthday is coming up and I guess he told his mom I wanted makeup from the brand, because today he texts me “what do you want from rare beauty” and I say “nothing, it’s okay” he says “just tell me” and I say “nothing babe really it’s fine I don’t want it please don’t spend your money” (he always insists so I didn’t think this time was any different) Then he texts again, I didn’t respond quickly because I was busy, 2 minutes later he says “Well you didn’t answer so my mom got some lipstick and blush that we agreed on”. ???
This upset me because he knows I told him I did not want it, and that I don’t like surprises, ESPECIALLY when it comes to makeup I would rather tell the person what I want to make sure they get their money’s worth or else I feel bad because I can’t use the product/don’t like it. I had no idea they were at Sephora, he didn’t communicate that to me, so I didn’t feel the urgency to suddenly do research on the products to see what I wanted and see what worked for my skin. I just thought he was casually looking to order online. He says “You knew it was urgent, I said ‘just tell me’ and you didn’t tell me, then you weren’t answering, so we decided for you”. 
Now in his mind he was being thoughtful because he asks what I wanted before purchasing, I would’ve complied but he doesn’t even say anything along the lines of “listen I know you don’t want anything but me and my mom are at Sephora and she really wants to do this for for you, I know you only wear specific things so please tell me I need to know now before making a purchase”. 
So he is upset that I told him one of us has to return it because I don’t want to accept products that I can’t even use because it makes my lips bleed and crack and my skin break out. He says it’s not his fault and that his mom just wanted to do something nice for me and I should accept the gift. I didn’t mean to come off as bratty and ungrateful, I guess I should just accept the gift and thank her, I just feel bad because his mom spent money on products I can’t even use when he could’ve prevented that. Now one of us has to go through the hassle of returning it, when this could’ve been avoided. He knows I wear specific products and I feel like he could’ve just called me after seeing i wasn’t answering texts, to make sure I was getting something I wanted and she wasn’t buying something I can’t use. Or he at least could’ve told her about the things I absolutely don’t wear. 
Ugh, am I being a brat? I mean is it so wrong for me to think that you shouldn’t buy people makeup products without asking them first? Clothes is a different story, but when it’s makeup, it’s going on your skin, and if you don’t know whether or not it works for that person or whether the person even wears it, you shouldn’t just buy whatever. I get that he did ask me, but he didn’t get an answer."

1601762657,Makeup,Am I using the wrong foundation finish??,"I've been using Mac Studio Fix Fluid Foundation and Mac Pro Longwear Concealer (both have matte finish) for 3 years. Lately when I put my Foundation &amp; concealer on it's giving me lines/creases under my eyes that aren't there when I don't have makeup on, it's also making my skin look like it's peeling/flaking on my chin and around my nose...
I never had to pay too much attention to the rules of makeup &amp; skincare but I figured since I'm not in my 20s anymore, maybe I should. I realized I have combination skin so I'm thinking the matte finish isn't working correctly...?
So I'm looking into trying Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation ( I received a sample w/my last Mac purchase and I absolutely loved it!)
Do I need concealer with luminous silk foundation? And should my concealer be a matte, dewy or natural finish??
Another problem is when I put on my Mac studio fix powder at the end of my routine, it's not really blending into my skin, it looks like it's just sitting on top of it giving the illusion of small peeling circles on my nose and forehead...
If I use a luminous foundation should my concealer and powder also have a luminous finish or no?"

About a month ago I (Cis female) started dating this girl. She’s transgender, MtF, but basically is pre-everything (No hormone therapy, no surgery, no body hair removal) and only dresses up every once and a while at home, but is otherwise entirely incognito, and only out as a woman to a few people, including myself. 

She admitted over drinks last night that she’s been feeling really dysphoric lately, so I feel like it’ll really perk her up if I got her something, like some new makeup. Ive seen her makeup bag, and she only has a few lipsticks and some eyeliner, since she doesn’t know what to get for herself. I was thinking I would surprise her next week after I get paid and take her to Target or something to pick out some makeup and maybe some new clothes, then teach her how to use her new makeup and have a little photoshoot :) 

While I do wear makeup occasionally, the only thing I’m stuck on is what I should get for her exactly. I know she needs a greenstick, concealer, foundation, a beginners eyeshadow palette, and some kind of mascara, but is there any specific products or foundation brands that might help cover the early stages of her facial hair growing in? She can’t shave every day or she breaks out, but luckily it grows slowly.

1601864693,Makeup,Update: My boyfriend is upset I want to return the gift his mother got for me,"Hi everyone, I didn’t think I would get as much comments on my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/j4nee3/my_boyfriend_is_upset_i_want_to_return_the_makeup/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) as I did so here’s an update. Most of you were kind and gave your two cents along with some advice and it helped me see that the issue at hand was bigger than makeup. It boiled down to his habit of getting me things even when I tell him seriously “please no, I don’t want it”. It was the fact that he told his mom to get me these products after I told him I didn’t want them. But I know now that when his mom asked him what she should get for me the first thing he remembered came to mind. But yeah, it wasn’t the first time where I expressed my concerns that I genuinely didn’t want him to get me ‘item A’, and he turns around and gets me item A. I know some people think it’s weird that I don’t like accepting constant gifts from my boyfriend. That I should be “so lucky he even remembered a brand I liked”. But I don’t pull the cute formality card with him, when I say please don’t get me it, I mean it, you know? It was cute the first couple of times but then I was fed up with not being heard/being taken seriously. I talk about being interested in a lot of makeup/stuff in general but doesn’t mean I want him to get them for me. It sounds super ungrateful I know, but I just didn’t want him constantly buying me things. I know someone out there feels the same way?? He realized this when I talked to him about it and apologized, and I’m not upset anymore because I see that he does it with good intentions. As for me getting upset about the lipstick, that was just anger that stemmed from the bigger problem. As you guys said lol I can’t expect him to remember all my makeup concerns, it’s okay that he doesn’t remember I don’t wear lipstick in the same way I don’t remember whether he uses gel or pomade in his hair. I see how silly it is now and we’re both working on it. Either way I’m lucky his mom wanted to do something nice for me and I’ll be exchanging the gift for probably some lip balm 😂 Thanks y’all"

Hi all! Long time lurker, first time poster.

I’m looking for some help with an issue I have with my nose. I hurt it a few years ago playing sports (probably broke it, but not sure) and now my nose is crooked. From certain angles it looks fine and you can’t really tell, but from other angles it looks awful and insanely messed up and angular. I’m especially embarrassed because, for whatever reason (maybe lighting or the angle of the camera?) it looks HORRENDOUS in video calls for work, and I get distracted by looking at myself instead of paying attention, lol.

I would love to get it fixed in the future but for now, that’s not an option, so I would love to hear any tips about how to contour (or otherwise disguise) a crooked nose. I can’t seem to figure it out and everything I do makes it look worse or does nothing. Any advice? Does anyone know of any video tutorials that could help? Thanks so much!"

1602003340,Makeup,MAC blotting powder substitute?,"I used Clinique makeup for years. I used Stay-Matte foundation in shade Alabaster and the pressed powder in Buff, I think it was. Whichever was the lightest. Unfortunately they made some formula changes and these colors no longer worked for me. They looked orange on my skin. I tried switching to a different color, but could never find one that matched well enough to my skin tone. 

So I switched to MAC Studio Fix fluid foundation in NW10 and the blotting powder in Light. Both of these colors work great for me. However, I feel like the powder goes super quickly. Maybe you don’t get as much as with Clinique, or maybe I just have to use more to get the coverage I want, or maybe it’s a different formula and you just end up picking up more on the sponge each time, I’m not sure. I just know I blow through it, and I’m tired of spending $30 on face powder that doesn’t last long. 

Can anyone recommend a decent drugstore pressed powder that is a good color match to the MAC light blotting powder? Just your typical oil-control, foundation setting powder.

1602096069,Makeup,Liquid foundation/concealer not sticking to upper lip area and getting wiped off when applying powder (trans MtF),"Hi all,   


I've been having some serious issues when doing my make up in the morning and I tried searching around on here to see if anyone had a similar problem but I couldn't find anything similar. I should mention that I am a transperson, so I sadly have to shave daily and that unfortunately does irritate my skin heavily despite me doing proper after shave care and having a daily/nightly skincare routine.   


My main issue when I do my make up is that I can't seemingly for the life of me get liquid products to stick properly to my upper lip/""moustache"" area - it can look halfway decent, but when I try to apply some setting powder/and or want to add some colored powder for some extra coverage/contouring more often than not all of my liquid make up underneath gets wiped off, revealing my disgusting red skin underneath. I am using a primer (Smashbox Photofinish/Primerizer), and no matter what method I apply my foundation with (sponge, brush, fingers) the results tends to be the same... even supposedly ""bulletproof"" foundations like Mac Pro Longwear, Nyx Can't Stop Won't Stop and Clinique Beyond Perfection just flat out doesn't work on this area and it's really driving me mad with anxiety every morning that I just can't cover this damn upper lip area without something going wrong and I have to mess around with concealers for an extra 20 minutes just to get a subpar result... it's really hurting my self esteem and I find myself quite frankly having a hard time getting out of bed on most days just because I know that my daily routine is gonna be a struggle just because of my upper lip. I do think that eventually someday after I've had laser hair removal done I can let my skin heal and this may become a non issue but due to my finances being so tight right now that sadly isn't an option for me, and my facial hair growth is immense, so not shaving is sadly not an option either.  


Any tips/suggestions would be super helpful, and please don't be affraid to ask about specific products I use in my routine if you need more info.

1602115980,Makeup,Closest substitute for Bare Minerals loose mineral eye shadow?,"I've used Bare Mineral's loose mineral eyeshadows for over 10 years. I've tried other eyeshadows, and nothing stays like they do on my skin. I love how it's soft and not cakey. Great pigment. I also do my entire face of makeup in under 3 minutes, so I love how easy it is to just tap into the cap and apply, and it stays all day without primer. 

I recently learned they discontinued like 90% of their colors. There used to be hundreds. Now they have like 40. 

I am not high maintenance when it comes to makeup, so I'm not too savvy on brands. I only wear matte neutral colors. Lots of browns/nudes/skin tones. Sometimes a mauve. 

What brand should I look into? I'm almost out of eyeshadow. I am willing to spend whatever it takes for a good substitute."

So I’m in a huge transition from wearing “medium” make up everyday to only brows and mascara. In the shut down of my state and mask wearing, I really cut down buying and using make up products. I dived into skin care.. got some fillers and dysport and a chemical peel, but now feel like I want to keep to minimum make up. My skin is awesome. I have a great routine for my 30(+) year old skin!

Here’s where I need advice: I don’t feel like my personality matches a no make up look! So what brands out there are suited for more natural or no make up looks? I still want to feel super girly getting ready in the morning and feel put together. Make up did that for me! 

For people who also made this switch, what are your thoughts and why did you make the move?

But a red flag was definetly yesterday when i used the lipgloss (that has a weird minty taste, does anyone know if that's normal?) and today when i woke up my lips were all chapped.

I'm starting to take a lot of care of my skin so thinking that i spent all this money (had to spend a lot on shipping and taxes) on something that could be hurtful it's heartbreaking.
I've searched the box like crazy but it doesn't have a fabrication or an expiration date (or at least not that i could find).

I've been dotting a pea-size amount on my face (forehead, cheeks, nose, chin) and then let it set for 5 minutes before applying the BB Cream. Is that the correct way to do it? I've heard the best way to apply foundation after applying the Primer is to do so in matter of minutes. Because if you wait too long the primer will dry into your skin and it might effect the way the makeup looks."

About 2-4 years ago my sister and I went to an Ulta and while she was looking at stuff I decided to mess with some eyeliner. I have no idea what the brand was, but the pricing was at least $20+. The eyeliner came in at least black and dark green (evergreen), and I want to say there was like, blue (navy), red, maybe a white? The pen was small, like a pencil, it was liquid eyeliner and the cap had a bow on it. All I remember about the brand was gold calligraphy as the writing on the pen but I’m not sure. 

This was the BEST eyeliner I had ever swatched. I put it on the back of my hand, let it dry down, and rubbed it, *hard* with a sweaty palm and it ***did not wipe away or smear at all***. Now I have the funds to purchase said eyeliner but can to find it on Ulta’s website. Please help direct me to the brand/formula!

Thanks in advance!"

I have a really hard time trying to do eyeshadow or eyeliner (which is hard enough on it's own) because I can't keep just one eye closed. Both eyes sure, no problem, just one eye?

Any recommendations of YouTubers who are in this gray area would be much appreciated (even if they still wear foundation and lashes sometimes).

They're not mentioned in any ""new in makeup"" or ""will I buy it"" type of videos, there's relatively few reviews positive or negative, and no ""full face of (brand) videos.

I know there are different brushes for different things you're doing in the look and that's not my question. I'm asking more like, for example, when you go back and blend after each color you put on. Or when she pats 3 different colors in the center of the lid to do a dark to light gradient... Are you just supposed to use 3 different flat/packing brushes for this? Or is there a handy way to clean as you go?

I'm going for a relatively natural look, nothing overdone, but I've read that false eyelashes (individuals) make a huge difference in pictures.


As of recently, I started using Lancome Monsieur Big mascara, which truly is a game changer. I naturally have length and volume in my lashes, so with 2 layers on, they are already pretty visible, although never as much as when I put individuals, of course. 


Thing is, I'm afraid to put them on my wedding day cause I probably won't have such a steady hand, I don't want to make a mistake that would take a lot of time to repair and honestly, it would be less stressful to just skip them.

I'd like to preface by saying for personal reasons she doesn't like to use limited edition stuff, which is why she is looking for dupes for these particular products.

As for the dupes or recommendations she was interested in

Highest priorities:
- Hua Mulan Lux Lipstick from Colourpop's Mulan collection. She saw Temptalia tried to make a dupe list, but she thought it looked more pink in their photos than what she wanted. She liked this lipstick a tad less bright like the colors on the official page's lip swatch photo for Hua Mulan (2nd photo on the page).
- Strong Chi from Colourpop's Mulan collection. Comparing the pictures on Colourpop's official lip swatches on the pages, she thought Take a Bao Lux Velvet Lip might have been close, but decided it was more pink than Strong Chi on the lips, so probably not the best dupe.
- (2 here) Little Snow and Going North Lux Lipsticks from Colourpop's Frozen 2 collection. She likes both of the official page's lip previews here too.

Medium priority:
- Really bold red lipstick with a magnetic closure? She fell in love with Kesha's from Hip Dot for comparison for both color and the magnetic closure/its packaging.
- Lip plumper that also changes color based on pH? She also fell in love with the one from Kesha and Hip Dot, but all she can find is either just lip plumpers or just pH changing ones. Not two in one like the Hip Dot one. She does have a Colourpop lip plumper though so if any of you guys just have a really nice pH changing one to recommend only, that's fine too.

Lowest priority:
- Jeffree Star Soul Sucker liquid lipstick
- Jeffree Star Succulent gloss
She just can't find any colors even close to the above two.

If anyone could help in anyway possible with recommendations or possible dupes, it would be much much appreciated."

1599177380,Makeup,Selena Gomez doesn’t deserve any hate for Rare Beauty,"I think the main reason people are against her release is “I don’t think about makeup when I think about Selena” but the same thing can be said about Rihanna, and many big makeup brands that are owned by people like old men or women who barely engage in the makeup world or do it themselves. Why is Selena being told she shouldn’t get into the makeup world? I bet she has a lot of experience from getting her makeup done being a singer and actress.

Of course I think the makeup world is oversaturated because there seems to be new releases by people all the time, but when I think of a money grab I think of those beauty gurus or influencers who just slap their name on a palette or release a line with a credited brand. I say it’s obvious Selena has spent a lot of time and put a lot of thought into her brand, there’s a bunch of shades and her packaging looks professional and timeless, it looks like a brand that’s going to stay.

Seriously, why are people hating on her so much? She’s 28 and has been in the spotlight as a singer and actress for a long time now. Maybe she wants to build a brand for herself to develop and work with as she gets older."

1599218232,Makeup,I rediscovered my love for makeup! Tell me your feelings currently!,"Hello everyone :).

I’ve loved makeup since before I can remember. 

I used to work nights so I had plenty of time to sit down and do my makeup before shifts. 
That kind of went away when I started a full time job (8am-6pm minimum 60 hours a week). And when I moved house, I moved further out. So for me to do a full face and get to work on time, I need to be up at 5am (boo!). 
I also can’t do a quick 10 minute look, hate them on me and envy those of you who look good with them!
So I’ve been barefaced at work more often than not. 

So a few weeks ago, my city went into stage four lockdown, my work shut down temporarily so I’ve been at home. 

So, I’ve tried new looks, techniques (courtesy of Jamie Genevieve), tried new products I’ve had for ages but never had the balls to try before a full work day in case they didn’t work with my skin or other products. I’ve also fallen back in love with products I haven’t used in ages. 
I’ve worn makeup more during this lockdown than I had at work in like 4-5 months. Maybe more!

I was so happy that I rediscovered my love for it that just before my shower tonight my boyfriend caught me staring at myself in the mirror! 

Tell me how you’re feeling about makeup at the moment. Have you been lucky too? Been barefaced more? Found new products or techniques?"

1599229379,Makeup,The slight transition to more no makeup makeup looks and natural looking makeup campaigns in the industry is making me fall in love with makeup and myself again,"Really got into makeup around 2015 and would spend hours practicing technique, watching YouTube tutorials and trying new looks. It only took about 2 years later makeup started to make me feel overwhelmed. I was spending so much money trying different products, my acne got worse bc I was constantly wearing heavy make up and in all honesty got more insecure and felt like I NEEDED to wear foundation/makeup to go anywhere. Safe to say I kinda fell out of love with makeup and felt was like it was something I needed to put on in order to feel “safe”. 

Last year, I was on Pinterest and saw an ad for Glossier and saw how natural the makeup line was. I started with their skincare (Milk Jelly Cleanser) and then eventually caved to their makeup products (boy brow, and pro tip eyeliner) and absolutely fell in love. Glossier gets a lot of hate for “not being real makeup” but I think it’s a start to something great. Easy makeup that embraces your skin despite any flaws and I’m totally here for it.  I have been seeing a lot of natural makeup lines/products lately like Selena’s Rare Beauty and Cover Girls skin tint and I like where the beauty industry is going.  Natural makeup lines and products has made me excited about makeup again and at the same time embracing and loving my skin despite the acne scars. Selena Gomez said in her recent Vogue makeup tutorial, “makeup should be an accessory” and I totally agree with that. I hope this all makes sense. 

All this to say I haven’t cared about makeup in like 3 years but the natural makeup campaigns have me more excited about makeup again bc I feel like I can embrace my natural beauty including my flaws."
1599233526,Makeup,Finding the right lipsticks (and foundation) at the moment when you can't try on loads?!,"Hi everyone,

I live in the UK. I really want to buy some new lipsticks but I don't know what to do because I have yet to set foot in a big department store (Selfridges would usually be my first port of call). How can I find the right one without trying on several? I'm really bad at knowing what flatters me so when I go shopping, it's usually quite an expedition!

The same goes for foundation and I definitely think I need another one as I tried on my normal winter one and I think I am still too tanned because my husband said I looked like a ghost (isn't he the sweetest...). 

What have you guys been doing?"
1599236157,Makeup,Best recommended BB cream or foundation for a makeup newbie with sensitive skin?,"Hiya!! 

I am 26F and I’ve never used any BB cream or foundation before. I only purchased BB cream from Physicians Formula at a CVS recently ( light/medium color) and unfortunately, it left such a gray ashy cast that my BF said I looked like a zombie. I washed it off IMMEDIATELY. 

I am always super duper paranoid that face makeup (as in, foundation or BB cream or CC cream) would break me out tremendously. But I will be going to a wedding in a week and I would love to dress up and look as nice as possible. 

If I do put on makeup for my normal routine, I typically just do mascara, lipstick and eyeliner. I am medium/tan skin toned (south Asian— skin tone of Priyanka chopra-ish) and have very sensitive skin (rosacea prone/gets bumpy and itchy if it’s messed with too much). 

I am from the US and was going to head to Sephora to check out what they have. Since I’m so new to makeup, and paranoid about my skin condition post-makeup application, I was going to try out BB cream since I hear it’s less harsh than foundation. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? I’ve looked up reviews and it seems that all BB creams (ItCosmetics, Dr.Jart, Clinique, etc) have both fans and people who hate it. If you think foundation would be better off, I’m open to trying too. 


TLDR- newbie to makeup. Looking for either foundation or BB cream that won’t break me out or irritate my sensitive/bumpy-rosacea skin."

Where/how should I start?"
1599249321,Makeup,Foundation recommendations,I have combination skin. I need to find a good foundation. I’ve never bought high end foundation because I go through it pretty fast. I’ve been using the L’Oréal 24 hour liquid foundation. It’s always worked until summer hit. Now my pores show and wearing a mask makes it worse. I need help please! I do not want dewy looks either it makes me look terrible at the end of the day.
1599250894,Makeup,Does anyone feel worse wearing no make up make up?,"Like I will admit, I am definitely a full face kind of person. I don’t contour or bronze but I like a medium coverage and to conceal and highlight. I don’t wear falsies but I do like heavy mascara and I like a very noticeable eye look, usually something grunge or dramatic or bright or smokey. Like it’s very obvious I’m wearing make up. 

However I find no make up make up makes me feel worse about myself than not wearing make up at all. Like I somehow feel more unnatural than in heavier things. Like I know I don’t look like that. I’m fine with not wearing make up and I’m fine with looking tired and like how I look without it as much as one can in this day and age.

Out of curiosity I’ve been trying more no make up make up looks and I just...don’t feel right in it. It’s like the uncanny valley of looking at myself. 

Like does anyone else have this? Or am I just nuts lol. Sorry to be the downer of the no make up make up movement but I feel like I’m going crazy and I wanna know if I’m the only one who feels this uncanny valley feeling when looking at themselves with no make up make up."

I love the last row of the Tartelette in Bloom palette and the Kaja Glowing Guava trio, but I'm having trouble finding full-blown palettes with mostly these reddish/pinky/mauvy-neutral tones without going TOO red (I like it more muted) or too berry-toned (prefer a warmer red over a cooler berry color). Is it just me, or does it seem like most warm-toned neutral palettes tend to lean more orange/yellow/copper? I don't really enjoy orangey or peachy neutrals as much, and most palettes with the tones I'm looking for only have a small section of shadows I'm interested (like the Tartelette in Bloom palette, which I don't get much use out of the first two rows). Maybe the tones I'm going for are too particular or not a popular choice for neutrals?

Any good recommendations? I've been eyeing the 3CE Overtake palette for its rosy neutrals, but it's a bit pricey for me and not as accessible in the US. Open to both drugstore and high-end since I can deal hunt. :) Any help would be immensely appreciated!"

I always see pictures of people wearing the prettiest shades but mine never looks that good irl. I just got the tarte lip paint, excited for it since it’s long lasting. It made my lips look dry so I put on chapstick and then it was moving around too much so I just had to take it off. When you reapply do you basically have to start all over? I wear lipgloss with a tint to it every so often and I feel like that gets patchy too. Again am I just expecting too much??

1599767093,Makeup,[Question} Where does feminism's fit into makeup,"I'm a makeup artist, love to play with makeup and am also a staunch feminist.

Feminism to me means choice.  If you like to play with makeup do it, but do it for you.  At the same time I started wearing makeup out of insecurity (no longer the case).  The implied questions----are men more vain than men?  Are they more superficial?  Is it anti-feminist?  Is it frivolous?  Are we taking women backwards?  Objectifying ourselves?  Does it imply that women need 'fixing'?  These are questions society confronts me with.

The history is also fascinating.  First wave feminism would say dress like a man and if you use makeup you're backwards, though second wave has changed.  How do you deal with loving makeup and being a feminist?  What message are we sending or wanting to make sure we send?

I recently am considering buying the hourglass blush or bronzer as someone offered to buy me something makeup as a birthday gift. I like powder blushes for their longer wear as normally I get oily in those zones, but I like the natural look and the dewy fresh look of cream bronzers. I'm also a student who wears makeup but only to look natural, is the Hourglass a good option? I've heard its so finely milled that I'm hoping it gives me that natural look that doesn't give me a powdery look and lets me keep my glow. However, the price is discouraging and even though I would be getting it as a gift, I'm only a student so idrk. It does look pretty af tho ngl

Also, over a year ago I splurged and got the Kosas bronzer/blush/highlight duo in tropic equinox. It was a hella splurge but I haven't used it much and I'm planning on getting back into using it, i had nothing too big against it plus it was expensive. However I noticed it has this smell? Its not necessarily a bad smell tbh, its just not a good smell. However, I've never used clean products and I know they're like super natural w/o fragrance, is it supposed to smell like that? I think i recall the same smell in the Sephora tester product when I first bought it, but I dont remember if when I first opened the brand new product it had that smell (it might have). Is this normal? It's not too bad but its not pleasant. However, my memories spotty, so please dont take it as an automatic ""its a bad product"" - it could just normally smell that way and I dont recall it being so."

When I tried it on for the first time it looked really really good and I still love wearing it, however when I took it off that night I realised that it had really really irritated the skin near the corner of my eyes. Because my skin was so irritated I also felt unwell, my skin was sore and I had headaches (might be unrelated but it’s happened everytime). It went away after a day or two. I wore it the other day for my friend’s birthday and tried to keep it away from sensitive areas on my skin. When I took it off however, I realised I had an array of spots on one side of my face and the same symptoms of sore/hot skin and headaches. I also had the same looking spots on my hand which I had used to blot my makeup sponge. I’m fortunate enough to have clear skin on my face most of the time so the spots are definitely connected to the foundation.

I like to wear light coverage foundations - my everyday is the MakeupForever water blend face&amp;body, but also dabble in a light wash of Georgio Armani's luminous silk for slightly more coverage, or Glossier skin tint for less coverage.

People also recommended me e.l.f brushes but when I checked the price, they are more expensive than the Morphe brushes I was considering. So, without further ado, let me list out the things I’m gonna buy and I hope you guys can let me know what you think! :)

1596822200,Makeup,Minimal Office Make Up Look,"I have never used makeup before but am going to work soon so I wanted to look professional. So, I am looking for advice for super minimal everyday makeup looks for a beginner.

I do not have acne or any discolouration on my face so I don't really have much that I need to hide except for eye bags. I would prefer not using foundation or blush either as I don't want to use too much product.

Based on some research I have done, I would plan out my make-up routine as follows:

1.Fill in eyebrows with eyebrow gel and blend it out with spoolie
2. Conceal under eyes and eyebrow area (where hair has been plucked) with a concealer
3. Apply dark brownish eyeshadow to eyelid [Can I skip this step?]
4. Apply eyeliner
5. Apply mascara

It would be great to get some advice on the make-up routine or if I'm overlooking anything (exp. Do I need to prime my eyelids with concealer before applying eyeshadow?). Any help would be appreciated."

I tend to gravitate towards rosey nude colours, or my lips but better colours (ie. glossier lipstick in shade like). I was looking into the Love Me lipsticks in the shades under the covers, as if I care, and maybe Hey Frenchie (I think this might be too mauvey however). I was also looking into the Powder Kiss formula in the shades sultriness (I think this may be too light of a pink) and a little tamed (I think this might be too bright). Please let me know your insight if you have these shades! I apologize for the long post."

1596854371,Makeup,PF Butter Bronzer hype...,"Kind of a dumb rant / complaint post, but after hearing about the butter bronzer for years I saw it on sale at Ulta and finally decided to go for it. I’m just... really disappointed??

First off I’m light medium to maybe barely medium since I have a tan right now, and didn’t expect a shade named “Bronzer” to be so light, especially when there’s a Light Bronzer shade as well. I don’t really prefer a super strong bronzer either. I love Sephora Los Cabos which many would consider pretty light, but this one was significantly lighter than that. I guess that’s on me for not checking swatches online more thoroughly, but it does seem like I’ve seen many youtubers my skin tone use this shade with no issue so I’m just a bit surprised at the color.

Issue #2 is sort of related. I found this bronzer to be way too shimmery. I definitely prefer bronzers more matte and I knew this one had a sheen and was excited to switch it up, but it was significantly more pronounced than I expected in the light. Combined with the shade it almost looks like a blush or highlighter on me even though in the pan it appears darker and much less glowy.

And then the last thing is OH THE SCENT. I’ve seen so many people raving about this and calling it “tropical” and saying it reminds them of vacation. I think they may have even made some kind of fragrance out of this? But wow - to me it smells just like a cheap Malibu and Coke, and triggers freshman year of college memories. I’m usually not too sensitive to scents but I actually really really struggle with this one.

Idk, I’m not just trying to hate on what seems to be many’s holy grail, if it works for you that’s awesome and obviously don’t let me take away from that or anything. I guess I’m just wondering if I’m doing something wrong here or if anyone else has had the same experience? Or otherwise, for those that love this bronzer, what is it about it that’s so great for you? Any thoughts would be appreciated!"

1596916082,Makeup,Can anyone recommend a good cream bronzer that doesn’t necessarily need a foundation base?,"Hope you’re all having a nice weekend!

So I don’t wear foundation or tinted moisturiser day-to-day - just concealer on any blemishes/dark circles - but without foundation I can look a little sickly so I like to warm my face up with bronzer. I’ve struggled to find one that stays on my face without a foundation base to stick to, and finally bit the bullet and tried the Chanel Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream. I’d seen reviews from people with oily skin saying it was no good but my skin is dry-combination and eczema prone in some parts so I figured I’d be okay.... I was wrong. It stays on my skin all day and is the perfect texture and colour for me, I absolutely loved it on application and thought I’d finally found my holy grail, but after a few days of use I started getting huge cyst spots in the areas where I’d used the bronzer, presumably due to the large amount of coconut oil in the new formula. 

SO, so you guys have any recommendations for a cream bronzer I can use, preferably but not necessarily without the need for foundation? It’s such a staple in my beauty routine that I’m not opposed to investing in a luxury product as long as it’s worth it.

Thanks! 🧡🧡"
1596926209,Makeup,Help a newbie find some adequate tutorials (foundation),"Hi! I'm 28 and until this day all I ever did was eyemakeup. That's mainly because I feel that makeup on any other area makes me look fake, whilst on the eyes I perceive it just as a little decoration (I'm not expressing an opinion here, just saying how I feel about it). The thing is, lately I've been feeling very bad about my skin: I really look like a wretch, so I would like to try some face makeup (foundation?). But why do I need your help, you ask me? Well, all of the tutorials I found are going very heavy (primer, many foundations, highlighter, bronzer, blush) while I was hoping to keep it very simple. Even tutorials with 'natural' and 'simple' in the title seem very heavy to me.
So, can you please help me find some tutorials that are noobproof and that keep the makeup to a real minimum natural/simple style?

I’ve been trying to find a product that can really hold my brows, and so far it seems that soap is the only thing to do it. I’m half asian with super thick hair/eyebrows, so most brow gels don’t have enough hold for me (even the benefit 24 hr one D:).

I recently tried the patrick ta major brow. This was a lot nicer on my skin than soap, but it didn’t have as much hold and left some white residue on my brows. I also have tried pear’s soap; this works really well, but my brows also have residue sometimes. I know Alexandra Anele uses Dr. Bronners, but I’m wondering what everyone else uses. I’m also looking at west barn co’s soap brow product, but it’s upwards of $30 once shipping is accounted for.

I always need to let my skin 'rest' for a good few moments after those because they can tingle- not to mention the fact that after using those the makeup applies differently than it would have the first time because the makeup remover is still technically on my face and making all my primers and foundations bumpier than usual. I've gotten to a point where I have enough skill to do my complexion relatively mistake free- but now I'm getting into eye shadows and eyeliner and I need to be able to undo my mistake and retry in less than the like half an hour I'm getting with these wipes!

1597005162,Makeup,Natural color vibrated for light eyes,"I've never worn contacts before but I've been thinking about trying some different colors for fun. However most of the ones I've found (OK all of them) look really obvious. Mostly with the heavily pixelated color or they're just too intense. My eyes are light blue so sooner if the contacts with a heavy dark exterior ring would look jarring. What I really want is a very subtle change in lighter colors like green or hazel. I haven't seen any that are a subtle as I want. Aside from that I also like the ones that are unnatural colors like [violet](https://www.unicoeye.com/products/dreamlike-prescription-purple-12-month-contact-lenses) or [rainbow](https://www.lensweets.com/collections/purple-contacts/products/fire-purple-yearly-colored-contacts), but again they're always too pixelated.

Is the dotted effect something that contacts yet always have or is it like you get what you pay for? If so which ones are better quality? Are custom contacts a thing? I know prosthetic contacts are but I don't need anything that's that incredibly high quality since it's just for fun. I would just like them to be subtle and not look like they're printed with dot matrix.

Oh and, do your eyes dilate normally with them in? I have kind of extreme light sensitivity so I'm a little nervous about it affecting dilation. And yes I'll speak to my ophthalmologist before trying any, but when I asked him about colors he only really knew about the common acuvues or whatever.

1597092138,Makeup,Boots 7 Stay Perfect mascara brush,"I am a longtime Blinc mascara lover. Tubing mascara is the only thing that keeps my oily lids from panda-ing, but at $26 it is pretty pricey so I was excited to see a post about other options available. I decided to try the Stay Perfect and knew right away I hated the brush. Teeny tiny bristles! I loved the big brush in Blinc’s, but for the almost $20 price difference gave it a shot.
Using the brush was not good, either. The formula is “wetter” than Blinc’s and the brush so small I smudged it all over my freshly shadowed eyelids. I decided trying a different brush would be a solution, little did I know how wrong I’d be!
I bought a set of normal looking mascara brushes from Sally Beauty to see if that would help my experience. You know the ones, little plastic bristles very close together. Well, I shoved a new wand in, rolled it around, and when I tried to pull it out, but couldn’t get it-it got STUCK 🤣 I tried twisting, tweezers, a Bobby pin....that thing wasn’t coming out! The diameter of the brush it came with is so tiny it can’t handle using other brushes 🤦🏻‍♀️

1597282829,Makeup,Makeup Trends and Techniques that I Hate :D,"Here are some of the makeup trends that I’m not a fan of. If you do any of these things, I’m not at all trying to knock you because the beauty of makeup is that everyone can do their own thing! Just wanted to hear your all’s thoughts on these trends and any other trends that you aren’t fans of :)

**“My skincare is my foundation”**

This is probably the one I hate the most. Light/natural makeup is trendy right now, which means we’ve turned to shaming or just generally looking down on people who wear full coverage foundation. First off, the condition of our skin is largely out of our control. Sure you can help it a little bit with proper skincare, and I know some people have found miracle cures, but a lot of our skincare expectations are just plain unrealistic. If you’ve got great skin and hate wearing foundation, kudos to you, but if you’re not happy with your skin and like coverage, cake that shit on, baby.

Second off, I don’t actually think there’s a strong correlation between the condition of your skin and the amount of coverage you like. Yes, foundation evens out your skin tone and covers blemishes, but it also functions as a canvas for the rest of your makeup. \*Nobody\* has skin that’s perfect enough to be an actual canvas, but I personally like my skin to be blank for the rest of my makeup. Foundation shouldn’t be about whether you “need” it or not, it should be about whether you enjoy wearing it! There are many reasons someone might want to wear foundation regardless of the condition of their skin, so let’s just let people wear what they want and love our skin regardless of how it responds to skincare :)

**Concealer under the eyes**

If you look at people’s would-take-to-a-deserted-island makeup musts, concealer seems to be there most of the time, and I always just assumed it was a non-negotiable. Whatever I did to it though, however I applied it, it never set, always creased, and always ended up looking weird, unnatural, and worse than before I’d applied it. To be fair, I do have fine lines under my eyes, but it took me a while to realize that concealer under the eyes is NOT a necessity. I think from Youtubers talking about their “dark circles” a lot of us just assume that we all have dark circles and naturally need to cover them with concealer but… most people don’t actually have dark circles under their eyes? The area around the eyes is naturally a contour of the face, and the skin there is darker because of normal human anatomy and not because you look like an insomniatic zombie. If you have ACTUAL dark circles and want to lighten them with color corrector or concealer, that’s completely reasonable (also completely reasonable if you don’t). But using a lighter shade of concealer to brighten under the eyes just looks strange to me knowing that it’s naturally a contour. I just quit putting any product under my eyes and my makeup looks so much better.

**Nose Contour and Brows**

I don’t have a problem with contouring in general. Makeup is about doing what you want to your own face. What I have a problem with is contouring to create an “ideal” shape and when you see Youtubers pointing out incorrect ways of contouring that actually make your nose look wider, I’m like... what’s wrong with having a wide nose? I’m not a fan of trends that involve natural features in general, including overdrawing lips to make them look bigger, drawing fake freckles, and, I know this is gonna be an unpopular one, but filling in brows. I use a tinted gel for my brows, but no matter how talented you are at filling them in I just don’t think it ever looks good. It’s fine if you have parts in your brows without hair; not every single square nanometer of your brow shape needs to have a hair follicle. I’m tired of hearing youtubers talk about their eyebrows “practically not being there” when, uh, they definitely have functional eyebrows. In my opinion, the brows you already have are the best brows for your face, so sure, shape em up a little bit, add some gel, but creating entirely new brows is just not my cup of tea.

It’s also sort of a slap in the face to anyone who naturally has these features (full lips, freckles, thick brows) and got literally made fun of for them and now all of a sudden it’s a trend and people are faking these features. Let the people who naturally have trendy features shine and enjoy your own features which are also beautiful! Beauty is diversity, not everyone looking exactly the same :)

**The Dewy Look**

Don’t get me wrong, I love a good glow, brands better keep pumping out those illuminating primers and skin tints, but actual WET looks just always look greasy to me. To me, dewy and glowy are two different things. I spent the entirety of middle school and high school trying NOT to look dewy and running to the bathroom in between classes to use oil sheets, so it would just be insulting to my past self to embrace the dewy look now, lol.

**“No makeup makeup”**

I like the actual concept but I HATE this term. I get that the point of it is to, well, wear makeup that doesn’t look like makeup, but for some reason it just irks me? Maybe just because I’ve heard it so many times by this point? But I just prefer calling it light makeup or natural makeup. Also, as someone who never wore makeup in middle school or high school or even most of college, now that I’m into it I WANT it to be obvious that I’m wearing makeup hahaha. I never got to have my unblended bright blue eyeshadow phase in middle school, so just let me have it now :)"

I have sensitive skin, my eyes are even more sensitive (even just water can irritate them) and can't really figure out how to apply eyeliner without irritating them and ruining my foundation in the process. 

I'm also trying to decide between liquid or pencil eyeliner (not sure which is easier for a beginner with somewhat shaky hands to work with); and I'm mainly focused on more subtle and natural looks, which seems to be easiest to achieve with greys instead of black.

I have tried all sorts of techniques- different foundation types(high end and drugstore), primers, no primer, powder, no powder, baking, setting spray. I have done it all. 

I don’t have good skin. I don’t really have much acne but I do have texture (mainly my nose which makeup will absolutely not sit on at all- like my foundation looks gross and patchy the moment I apply it to my nose).

I’m getting married (hopefully next year if Covid-19 doesn’t get in the way) and I’m looking for a dewy foundation that will last for my wedding. I don’t normally wear foundation but if I’m going to a special event I will either wear my juice beauty phyto pigments flawless serum foundation in 05 buff, my ITcosmetics CC matte foundation in fair when I’m tan, or my Tarte foundcealer in porcelain beige. I’m a light to medium coverage kind of girl because I cover spots with concealer. I have dehydrated combination textured skin, and I prefer a dewy finish. None of my foundations are currently as dewy as I’d prefer even though the tarte one comes close. I would like to powder my areas where I get oily like my chin, nostril area, forehead, etc but leave the rest dewy since I get dry spots despite a great skin care regime (I have autoimmune conditions that causes dehydration and dryness unfortunately). 

The only problem is that I’m a Mac NC10 in the winter (my wedding is scheduled for February) and that shade seems to be far too fair for most foundation lines and I don’t want to get a spray tan for my wedding.

1597358481,Makeup,IL.MAKIAGE,"Alright, rant time! :) 

I’ve been struggling with my foundation/concealer/primer situation recently, so when I saw an add for this brand, I thought I’d take their quiz. I was also bored and I love quizzes for some reason lol. So I do the little quiz and get to the end, and start seeing “try before you buy” everywhere. So of course, I’m interested. Long story short, I end up “ordering” a foundation, concealer and primer from them. I get a bad feeling when I read the message saying “not to worry” about a number showing up on my bank account and that it’ll surely disappear. I immediately go and check my bank account and I have a whopping $100+ transaction on there, and the $5 shipping. Me, freaking tf out because there is absolutely no way I can spend that much in makeup right now, I reach out to customer service and they just assure me it’s fine and it’ll go away. Fast forward, today I got the package. I was surprised by the packaging and how well out together it seemed. Until I actually started unpacking it. First, inside the box was the three items I ordered, along with a liquid eyeliner?? I didn’t order it, but for some reason it’s in my box and says I ordered it. I don’t even use liquid eyeliner EVER. The items were also warm, which I understand isn’t the brands fault, it is summer and it’s hot, but it didn’t make the experience better lol. I pull out the concealer, wanting to compare it to my current concealer to see if “my true shade” is the same as the one I’m using. Well, I go to open the bottle and the brush won’t come out of the tube. I pull a little and it yanks up, leaving a tiny hole surrounded by solid concealer. Uhhh...... So I go the foundation. I have to pump it several times to get anything to come out and when it does it sputters and spews it everywhere. I haven’t even tried the primer, I figured I’d put the products in my fridge for a few hours and try again later, but I am not at all happy. I figured if they were going to send me items I didn’t order and risk getting scammed of $100+ than I should at least be able to use the products. Wish me luck... I hope I can actually try these out. 😤😤"

Anyways, I use a sponge for my foundation and concealer and brushes for everything else, yet it’s kind of annoying how my fingers still get stained with face makeup and I found myself constantly washing my hands throughout my routine, which got tedious. 

Sooo I’ve decided I’ll probably use gloves 🧤 to combat the messiness, has anyone tried this? What do y’all do to reduce getting makeup stains around your counter, sink, etc? I fee like no matter what I do, I always get some foundation somewhere ugh."

I even wore it on my wedding day.
1593974791,Makeup,Looking for a neutral-cool toned Yellow powder foundation,"As the title says, I'm looking for a neutral-cool powder foundation with straight yellow undertones. As everyone knows, most cool-toned foundation has a pink tone, but I'm yellow. I currently use Mac Studio Fix powder in NC20 and it works okay, but it's still a little pink/beige on me. I also tried C3 (too warm and beige) and C30 (too warm and dark).

I'm finding I prefer powder foundation because liquid foundation just settles into my pores and doesn't stay in place (even with setting powder and setting spray). I don't have oily skin, but I think I have some texture issues causing this. 

For reference, Nars Gobi is a great shade for me, as well as Becca Shell. But I hated Sheer Glow and Becca Ultimate Coverage. (They looked amazing when first applied though).

I'm starting too think a cool-toned yellow powder foundation doesn't exist, but I just thought I'd ask. Thank you for reading"

However every single mascara that I have is smudging, even if it is waterproof.

Is there a mascara that can handle the dewyness or do I have to set at least my under eyes?

My idea is that I would like to wear a lipgloss/lipstick, maybe with some mascara, eyeshadow and highlighter as a daily look. (Sorry if I sound really uneducated on the makeup vocabulary, it’s because I am!) But would it look weird if I just wore this, without any foundation, or bronzer and blush or whatever? Would I look really strange without any of this, but still with lip and eye makeup on? And can I wear highlight without foundation and other face makeup, or is that weird too?

I would also like to know what a reasonable price is for types of products such as lipgloss, mascara and highlighter. I reckon maybe £20 is average for lipgloss/stick, but do you think this is too expensive, or even too cheap for a nice lipstick? Let me know if you recommend any brands for makeup, it would be appreciated. I’m not sure if it makes a difference but I’m half indian, so my skin is a little tanned. I’ve heard something before about it being harder to find makeup for darker skin tones, but I assume this is a bigger problem for black people wanting to find makeup, which still sucks.

Kinda new to the subreddit but did a good amount of searching and wasn’t able to find out much.

Anyways I want to know if there is a bunch of makeup brands that have interchangeable compacts that can be used with any brand or know if one exists. So for example a Dior compact that can go with a Mac compact (which I’m pretty sure doesn’t exist, but I just need to give an example).

I know that the vintage Stratton compact can be interchangeable with the Rimmel compacts, but I’m not a fan of the plastic waste and also that they aren’t cruelty free, I am also aware that the Jane Iredale compacts can fit the compact too, and/or you could crush up a compact and fit it in but again just not a fan of the waste that could come out of it. I am aware that Kat Von D has refills but I don’t know what other compacts it could fit.

1594312219,Makeup,Makeup for acne,"Hi there!

So little bit of background, I am a 27-year-old female diagnosed with PCOS. I am recently being treated for this with Metformin and although it has helped in a litany of ways, I still get a pretty bad case hormonal acne once in a while. Along with hormonal acne, I consistently have cystic acne in certain areas, sometimes more severe than other times. Anyways, I am hopeful entering the work world soon (recently graduated from grad school) and with that will come the want for me to wear makeup to feel more secure. Quarantine has been excellent for the condition of my skin and the few times I’ve put on makeup my skin went haywire again. This has always been the case (of varying degrees) when it comes to makeup. I’ve invested a lot of money into really expensive make up brands (Trish mcevoy, NARS, Bare minerals, la Mer, etc) and so far, to no avail, the makeup always makes me break out to some degree. I’m hyper vigilant about ALWAYS washing my face and removing my makeup properly as well as engaging in regimented skin care routines. Do you guys have any suggestions to recommend in terms of brands of makeup that will not only cover my acne but actively treat it. I’ve tried brands that claim to do this and while their products do not make me intensely break out, I have not found any as of yet that actively treat it. Let me know your thoughts! Thanks!"

1594322080,Makeup,Should I keep buying from Colourpop?,"I used to be a really big fan of Colourpop Cosmetics. I thought there products were beautiful and they seemed like such a unproblematic brand. I just thought everything seemed so perfect. I decided to buy two palettes from them in November and I was super excited. A little later in the month, I was notified that that package had arrived. A quick note to put in their is that at the time, I had lived in Spain so this was international shipping. I also lived in a boarding house and the staff there told me to send it to the school since packages tend to get lost when they are sent to the boarding house. When I went to the school to see if it was there it hadn't arrived. At this point I was very confused so I looked at the colourpop website and it said that sometimes it says that it has arrived even though it hasn't and that I should just wait a few days. Also for international packages it takes a certain amount of business days for it to come which is like 10 to 21 business days I think. They also said that they CAN NOT help you until these 21 business days are up. It hadn't even been 10 business days so I relaxed and waited till 21 business days was up. It still hadn't  arrived. Either the day of the 21st business day or the day after I sent them an email through their customer service website. I waited a week and didn't get a reply so I decided to sent the another email. I waited a little bit longer and still didn't get a reply so I emailed them one more time. I did get a reply this time. HOWEVER this email said that they could not help me since it had been two weeks since it says it had been delivered and at that point they can not help. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but I had followed all their rules before and they even said I won't have been allowed to contact them before the 21 days were over. But they can't help me? I have emailed them multiple times explaining this situation and they have only said that there is nothing they can do to help me. It had now been about 9 months and my feelings about everything have relaxed. Now I actually own colourpop items since before I realized they weren't gonna help me, my mom had bought me a few palettes for Christmas (not including the ones I had bought previously) and these palettes were sent to the States instead. This whole situation really upsets me since I love the palettes I have but I can't help but be sad that I never got my other palettes and never got my money back. I would love to continue supporting since I like the products but I feel like it would be extremely dumb of me to so that. Has anyone else experienced something similar with colourpop? I am very open to hear what I could have done wrong with this situation and I encourage you to ask any questions about the situation if I missed anything."

1594574118,Makeup,Tips for getting back into it?,"I'm a 22F who hasn't worn a ton of makeup for most of my life. I didn't play with  my first makeup kit until I was 13, and the way I was originally taught to use it was very heavy: primer, concealer, foundation, toner, blush- the whole nine yards. I also grew up with my mom having a very negative self image where she doesnt think she's naturally beautiful, and has used wearing heavy makeup as a crutch for seeing herself as beautiful and feminine for my entire childhood.

I fell out of love with makeup for most of high school with how heavy all the products i was taught to use made my face feel, and because I didn't associate my beauty with the makeup i wore on my face-- I liked natural me just fine, and didn't want to tangle my self-worth with whether i wore makeup or not like I'd seen my mom do. (Disclaimer: I have mommy issues.) I dont judge others who do wear a ton of makeup, but my childhood experiences with my mom put me off of the idea of wearing makeup in general, and I didn't start to wear it casually again until college, and even then I wore it very rarely.

After doing some introspection and self discovery for the last few years, I'm ready to start playing with makeup more in depth again. I still think I look fine all-natural, but I also want to have a positive relationship with makeup and learn to have fun dressing myself up with it when i feel like it- fancy occasions and casual occasions alike. My biggest problem is that I still haven't found my stride for a style that I like. I usually just play around with eye makeup and lipstick, since I've got oily skin and still dont like how heavy foundation and concealer feels, but I worry about it looking awkward since its just the eyes and lips that have been done up. I also dont really want to go back to doing a full nine-yards-worth of makeup like I was originally taught to try and make my style look more normal, though.

I‘ve owned some different mascaras in the past, and I always have the problem that when I put them on, I get clumps and my lashes sort of 'stick together' in little bunches so it looks a little spidery although I didn‘t apply a lot. I need one that keeps the lashes apart, doesn‘t clump and also wings them upwards since my lashes are pretty long and dark but point forward with nearly no curve at all.

I've tried three products so far with no luck: 

1. Morphe micro brow in Hazelnut (the darkest I've tried)
2. Maybelline Ultra Slim in Light Blonde (lighter than Morphe but still too dark for me)
3. NYX Micro Brow in Auburn (the most red toned.. but still off?)

NYX has been the closest so far in terms of colour, but it's still a bit... off..? somehow, and I'm not sure why. I'm not sure if it's because I'm just bad with the product because I have limited experience with it, but I'm finding it difficult to get enough coverage out of it as well as have my brows still look ""natural"". The most success I've had is actually using shadows in my brows to help make the colour more natural, but I found that the wear time wasn't that great.

If anyone has any product recommendations, or can even give me tips on how to get better at my brows, I'd love to hear it! Thanks :)"

1594649186,Makeup,Need new makeup for skin with eczema,"Friends :)

I have eczema and I’m always very affected by it (emotionally). I’m currently using a foundation by Clinique, a concealer from maybelline. And I really need help for these two items. I rarely visit Sephora or even drug stores lately coz they don’t have testers no more. So I bought my first foundation and concealers online and the colours really don’t fit my skin. No matter how much it looks when I try it on virtually, the colour is just off. Does any of you have any idea on how to get the right shades online for beginners like me?

Thank you!"
1594651104,Makeup,SMILE LINES....help!,"Background: I’ve been doing my own make up for years, so I have a pretty solid understanding of tips and what works/doesn’t. I love me a full beat. 

Foundation ALWAYS settles into my smile lines when I do a full face of make up. Whenever I go out for extended periods of periods of time, I either bring a sponge or a small brush just to smooth it out. For the most part, my skin looks great and the make up isn’t THAT obvious. However, when it starts to settle into my smile lines, it’s completely apparent how much foundation I have on 

I’ve tried: less foundation, avoiding the smile lines area, setting it with powder,not setting it with powder, various primers to fill the space. 
Any and all other suggestions welcome!"

So, I'm going to start by saying I'm super white, so all my makeup is for my skin tone, obviously.
That being said, I have a girl staying with my family who LOVES makeup and dressup and princess. Unfortunately, my makeup obviously doesn't work with her skin. Her skin is pretty dark. Not quite ebony, but like.... espresso? Anyway, I really want to be able to get her some costume makeup that actually works with her skin, so when I do her makeup I can do more than lips and eyeshadow. So I guess shade/color recommendations? Or any cheap products you would recommend? Or overall any other advice for doing makeup on dark skin is appreciated.

Thank you!

Is it possible that the infrequent use would make it safer to use for longer? If not, does anyone have any suggestions about how to make sure I have safe product and not have to buy new things every time?

- My eyes are very double lidded

When carving your brows out how do you work:blend the foundation down? And HOW do you get foundation to stay on your nose? Brush? Sponge?

1591518667,Makeup,"Being judged (read: shamed) for going for a natural/""no-makeup"" makeup look.","I have had acne issues for some time. Nothing major now that I am older, but there are some hyperigmentation marks since my skin is darker. I was seeing this guy and in the morning after showering once, he said something like ""I don't understand makeup. I think it's sad that you think you need it. You're pretty. I am not saying I am against it but I think it's sad."" What I heard is, I want to diminish you, your choices, and your appearance because I am jealous that women have a socially acceptable way to improve their appearance, and I am a balding male and don't want to wear a toupee for fear of coming off as vain. YET, I think you look better with makeup, so please keep applying it for me.

If you think that is the killer, he then said to me, on another occasion ""I don't get the whole makeup thing. It's sad."" I replied defensively, ""it can be an art!"" He said, ""but that's not what you are trying to do, is it?"" What I felt he was saying there, is that I am trying to deceive people by improving my appearance, that the ""natural"" look tries to come off as ""no makeup,"" and is therefore inferior. I felt so diminished by him. Just for a not: He was a pretty pererted 49-year-old who was seeing me, almost 20 years his junior. He had a predilection for women quite a deal younger than I too, so I shouldn't take his opinion too seriously. However, I am a little self-conscious about my appearance and it bugged me -- by which I mean it go into my head. I always have issues with my complexion and he just made me feel like shit about it. The issue is that I hate how I look without makeup and it takes a long time for me to trust someone before I go without makeup. It's not like I even get a reaction from guys, and I likely don't look drastically different, and my first husband met me when I didn't wear makeup for a few weeks when detoxing my skin, but I have such low self esteem that I feel I am unattractive without it :( Honestly, I am conventionally attractive (not extremely, but I do have certain forgiving facial features that if someone has a thing for eyes, for example, they will find me very attractive), but my skin on my face, ugh! The skin on the rest of my body is such a pretty dark cream. I am so jealous of it lol. I have nearly $700 of products but am so stressed that I do not get to apply them at night :( And I have been over-caffeinated. I don't think the skin products are enough, for sure. I have tried finding the right foundation for years and found a very light coverage one that works for me, yet I still have to feel like shit cus of some guy's insecurities. Clearly it is a self-esteem issue that I have to address, but he did not help!

TLDR: a dude I had a fling with sucked about women wanting to apply natural makeup, viewing it as deception and covert vanity."

 So I have never used foundation, I just use some concealer around the eyes and some compact powder afterwards.

This is my first time posting in here, but I’d really appreciate some advice.

I live in a different province for school but I’ve been trying to help by finding them a rental to stay in and doing some online shopping for them that they can go pick up in store. 

My mom loves to look nice and enjoys the makeup she had a lot, and wants to get new stuff. I barely wear makeup myself and don’t keep up to date on what’s good or not so I’m really not sure about what to pick out for her. I’m wondering if anyone has any suggestions for a palette I can find at Sephora or shoppers drug mart that kind of has everything in one, just for the convenience? I also read that the Lancôme skin feels good foundation is good for mature skin and is highly rated, but I’d appreciate any advice on face makeup as well for her.

Also, don't want a contour brush for cream contour. To be general, no flat brushes is wanted designed for cream or liquid products.

Coming to eyeshadow, blending brush and crease brush are the ones I need most, but I have no complains on eye brushes, any of them can satisfy me I think.

I was also suggested the makeup forever ultra hd foundation but since the color match was really off I didn’t get a chance to actually wear it to see how it performed on my skin. So if you have any opinions on this foundation let me know.

I liked the Cyo lifeproof and soap and glory kick ass foundations but both are being discontinued and they don’t really have an exact color match for my skin tone since I’m neutral and it’s hard to find an exact match.

I have fake lashes that I like (ardell natural babies) and some glue on the way  (Duo black brush on strip lash adhesive) and I'm getting decent at applying them but I ruined my last set trying to get the glue off the band, ended up pinching and folding a couple lashes. I decided to do some research and educate myself on how that should work. Well, I found that you should use an oil based makeup remover to remove them from your eyes and clean the glue off, this is there in really confused. There is conflicting information, some  say to use oil or an oil based makeup remover and some say don't put oil on the lashes at all, even to remove them, and others say to pick the glue off with your fingers or tweezers (that's not happening) So, the question: how do I remove and clean my lashes?? I'm a total no makeup girl, like none. My eyeliner is tattooed and mascara used to irritate my eyes so much they would fog up my contacts by the end of the day so I stopped using it years ago. Post lasik so I'm exploring makeup a bit again but I'm completely clueless and have next to no supplies or experience. Give me all the info!! Thanks everyone for any help you're willing to give, bonus points for Amazon links to products you recommend.

I bought UD all nighter primer and want to try it with it, but won’t have a day off for a while to experiment with it at home.","I have looked it up and keep getting different answers lol. I know in the grand scheme of things it’s not a big deal, but these masks are jacking my makeup up lol. In my frustration I ran into ulta after work and grabbed UD all nighter makeup primer and Nars concealer to try and make something work. The all nighter spray is my HG, but it’s not enough at this point. 

Well the primer is freaking water based and my foundation I usually use is Nars all day luminous and Tarte shape tape concealer which are silicone based. I work with the public all day, so I would like to be able to wear foundation but if I can’t at least concealers underneath my eyes and on my chin/around my nose for redness and acne when I take it off. My under eye looks gross by the end of the day from breathing up into my mask, and is so embarrassing. 

I know with everything going on this is a non issue, but doing my makeup is the only freaking thing that seems normal to me right now.

The last couple of days I have only done concealers until I figure out my foundation, but I can’t even get that to work right. I don’t want try it before a ten plus hour day and be stuck with even worse looking makeup than without it. 

I’m sorry the random rant, but I’m just getting so frustrated. Does anybody know or has tried this combo to see if it can last? The luminous silk by itself is going to melt off with the mask and the heat."

I'd prefer the undertones to be more beigey-neutral and not straight pink (although a little pink can be in there for balance.) 

I wouldn't describe my skin tone as fair, but definitely light. In the [Tarte rainforest of the sea foundation](https://www.sephora.com/product/sea-water-foundation-broad-spectrum-spf-15-P405102?skuId=1779156&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p405102:product) I'm fair-light-neutral and in the [NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer I'm the shade Vanilla](https://www.sephora.com/product/radiant-creamy-concealer-P377873?skuId=1478361). I have a neutral undertone. 

I really love the Mac lipstick in Myth, the notoriously light nude shade, but I have to wear it with a lip pencil to prevent having ""ghost lips."" My main issue is I don't want something too light since I already have Myth, and I don't want something too dark that gives my lips a brown look instead of a nude look.

1591931075,Makeup,Lip Wrinkles/Dryness with Lipstick?,"Hey y'all! I'm new here, first time posting. Lemme know if I break any of the rules.

So... I have some nice full lips. I love showing them off with bright and bold lipstick colors, from classic red to deep purple to bright blue. I love my colors. I go big or go home every time I wear makeup.

Thing is, no matter what I do, my lips always dry up and shrivel and wrinkle after about an hour of wearing any lipstick, and if I go to reapply the color on top it just looks cakey and blech. I always have to take it all off and start fresh, wipe/clean everything off as carefully as I can (so it doesn't smear onto my face/chin), and start over with my lip primer and lipstick color. This is regardless of the brand of lipstick I use. (Also, I use an Anastasia Beverly Hills lip primer if that's important.)

When I was a kid I had awful, icky, super dry lips. They were flakey and peel-y and itchy and gross. I later found that this was a big sign of a specific autoimmune disease and have since been diagnosed and under treatment. After ten years of treatment, I am now medically a ""normal"" person when it comes to my water retainment. I've been caring for my lips very well since my teen years and I apply vaseline whenever they start to feel dry/itchy. I stay hydrated (I only drink water, tea, and wine (rarely)), and I never have this wrinkling issue when my lips are clean/makeup-free or with plain lipgloss.

I thought that the wrinkling and drying-out were due to me talking and smiling and moving. However, with the quarantine, I've worn makeup for fun around the house (to try out all the cool colors I never touch in my eyeshadow palettes), and they still wrinkle! Even when I do nothing but sit around and watch Project Runway reruns! There's no bleeding into outer wrinkling, as I am still in my 20s and do not have outer lip wrinkles yet. My lips themselves just shrivel and shrink and look cracked where the wrinkles are.

So... What the heck? Am I doing something wrong? Is this a regular problem for people? Is there a chemical/component in lipsticks that dries up the skin/lips? Should I just expect this every time I wear lipstick due to my autoimmune disease? (That last one may be out of everyone's knowledge-zone, sorry.) What, if anything, can I do to reduce this issue?

Thank you so much in advance to anyone who answers! Even if you just respond with your own experience.

1591999203,Makeup,What is a last resort option for powder application when you’ve lost your powder brush?,"My daughter decided to grab my brush that I use for applying bronzer powder out of my bathroom to use for a TikTok video as a prop &amp; now it’s nowhere to be found.  I’m still self isolating and even when I order another one from Sephora it’ll take time to get here, so I was hoping there would be some common household things I could use to get by until a new one comes in the mail.  

I use this brush so my neck matches the color of my face with a bronzer powder that Sephora used on me and recommended when I went to their beauty session appointment.  

I’m not a makeup fanatic so I really have no other brushes on hand or other makeup tools.  This brush was bought specifically for the one powder that I own.

1592001022,Makeup,Natural Concealer Recommendations for Dark Circles,"I have genetic dark circles and I have my whole life. They are purple and more sunken in then they are puffy. In my current routine, I’ve been using the Becca color corrector and tarte shape tape. I ADORE the color corrector, however, the tarte shape tape looks so unnatural under my eyes unless I put on full coverage make up which is frustrating because I like to let my natural marks show through and not go super heavy on the foundation. I also have super dry skin, so I use cream products &amp; don’t like using powder anywhere except underneath my eyes (they crease very easily). I have tried adding a tiny bit of serum/oil to the concealer, to make it less cakey but it just keeps breaking up after a few hours. I use a lot of glossier products, so I tried out their super stretch concealer and that broke up after a few hours.

I know shape tape is very high coverage so I’m not looking for an exact match in coverage. All I’m looking for, is for a natural looking concealer with decent coverage."

1592016516,Makeup,JD Glow cosmetics costumer service is horrible. Am I over reacting?,"I placed an order for JD glow gel liners May 8. They shipped the next day. I kept tracking the package and it spent 3 days in NJ (I am in NY) then it stopped updating. 

I figured it’s a pandemic let me just wait and be patient, two weeks go by no updates. I asked USPS for an update they said they would look into it never heard from them. 

After several days I email JD Glow. They replied saying that it takes 4-6 week for their liners to be shipped, cleared they did not read my email, they just sent an automated response. 

One week later I replied again to let them know the issue again, they told me that I have to call USPS and find out what going on. So I asked them if that’s their way of saying that they take no responsibility for this package, because they still have my money. They replied saying they would look into it. 10 business days have passed since that last email, over a month since I placed the order. 

I have never had to contact costumer service for any online purchase before and I never had this type of issue before, is it normal for the costumer to have to solve shipping issues? And to have no response from a company for more than 7 business days, seems very unprofessional"
1592019665,Makeup,Why are my cut crease results never consistent?,"Hello all! I have recently begun doing cut creases and playing with more colors. I use the concealer method for my cut crease but I have concerns. The results are never consistent, I almost feel like I'm missing a step?

I use the same brand and color concealer I use for my face but I dab some on my hand and use a morphe brush to apply on my lids.

However results aren't great. Sometimes it dries to a tacky point and I begin adding shadow. When I do sometimes the shadow goes on well, but sometimes it's so patchy that I have to do major corrective work.

What gives?
Should I let concealer dry completely?
Is it the brand of concealer? (Fenty)
What else should I do?

I also should reference I have only been playing with Morphe shadows in these palettes (18T &amp; James Charles)"

I have no idea where to start with makeup, let alone skincare, and I’m hoping to start fresh with the right basics if anyone would be kind enough to share some of their favorite products or tips for a starting point. (If it helps, pretend I’m an alien and am learning about products all for the first time.)

I don’t have any products as I haven’t worn anything in years. Before that, I would just use whatever products my sisters were using (in the early ‘00s) and never learned much about what would be the right product for me. When I used to wear (minimal) makeup in high school, I literally used just eyeliner, concealer, and foundation. (And I’m sure I wasn’t even doing it right). The only other products I ever had (and never used) were blush and mascara. That’s really it.

I’m mainly looking to learn:
- the different benefits of certain products (ex: powder vs liquid foundation)
- the best products for my skin/complexion (and how to match my skin tone)
- what basics I would need for a natural look
- the best products to cover those basics

My skin is fairly pale, tends to be dry, is sensitive, and I do have acne (mostly from stress, touching my skin, and picking/scratching the acne). I’m also struggling to improve my skin care regimen as I’ve reacted negatively to several natural products. (If you have recommendations for moisturizers, regimens, or how to treat scars, they would be appreciated!). All I currently use is face wash and moisturizer. 

If you have any recommendations (or can direct me to an existing thread that already covers some of this), please let me know. Thanks for reading!"

The soft stick style eyeliners and some liquid liners work ok, but I'm wondering if anyone has heard of anything to help for this issue."

This is my usual makeup and I’m not too sure what I could add to look a bit prettier..if someone has any suggestions that would be amazing.

I’m looking particularly for a mascara that would help with my short flat lashes. I don’t see myself applying false lashes everyday to make my eyes look nicer so I was wondering what I could do instead. I did curl my lashes in the photo.

Apologies for the way my hair looks and I usually apply foundation on my neck as well so the color of my skin is more even.

1588892664,Makeup,Any brands similar to Colourpop or Sugarpill Cosmetics?,"Asking because besides knowing some brands, I'm still relatively new to makeup. Not to mention, I don't know alot of brands down the same style branch of my stuff. To give you n idea, I'm an artist in my late teens who is generally drawn to colourful makeup  as it gives me more freedom to express myself as an artist as well as a person,though mixed in with berry pinks,mauves and dark/warm nudes regarding lipsticks and glosses. And while I do have more than a fair share of nudes mixed in with what make up I have. I've been having trouble finding affordable brands that have more of a vibrant colour range similar to Colourpop. Especially ones that are certified to be cruelty free. For me, that's a extremely big deal since I don't support animal testing in any way.

As of now, I've been considering Mikyjay's. Though my issues there is I don't know if they are 100% certified to be cruelty free. And while I had considered Lime Crime back when I was just starting out since I've seen them around quite a few times. I've done my research on them and have decided to spend my hard earned pocket money else where because of the untrustworthy quality and more than a fair share of things the founder did which goes against my values. Also considered Jeffree Star, since I'm really fond of the colours his palettes have. But, I don't know if he's affordable. In general I don't know a single thing about Beauty Guru brands, except maybe from Hextian back over in Doll Customization world since he was the one who introduced me to Jeffree Star. Alot of the stuff I learned is from a combo of insta,self experimentation and my sis in law. But feel free to recommend a few to me because who knows. Maybe I just didn't find the right people yet.

Either way, all recommendations are welcome."

Idk if it’s some type of illusion from the window or something, but it doesn’t make sense to me because my skin is a cool/neutral undertone. I also can’t return them.

Money is tight, I have 3 kids and work part time from home, but I feel I need to make a splurge on a product  that will cover these wrinkles. 

Can anyone please point me to the right direction? What is the best foundation for women in late 30s with wrinkles under eyes? The wrinkles and dark bags are my main issue with my skin, but would also like a foundation that gives my skin a boost, makes it look younger if possible!

Like I said, this is a splurge for me, so I'm open to all brands, all products.

1588979396,Makeup,Wedding Makeup Woes,"Hey all... 

I'm getting married in 6 weeks (eeek!) and will very likely end up doing my own hair and makeup. Now, I know that there are other subs for wedding stuff, but I love what I've seen from people here and there's no one else I'd ask about makeup advice. 

For the first time in almost two months, I put on makeup today as I attempted to play around and figure out what I wanted to do for my wedding. But the results are so awful I could cry. I took pictures (without my falsies) and I hate it. 

I feel like I have an awful boring blah face with no angles (tried contouring for the first time today, can't tell a difference) and I tried a Too Faced highlighter that I thought I would love but feel like it makes my face more round and I feel like all the effort I put into eye shadow just came out looking like one mixed up color mess. 

Now, before anyone goes suggesting YouTube tutorials... Boy have I tried those. I've tried to learn about face shape and brushes and contouring and so many things, but I feel like it just doesn't work on me. 

The only thing I really love is my lipstick color, but I'm on the fence even about that because I don't want to get it all over my man. 

People who have done their own makeup for events... What do I do?

And it stays on well, doesn’t smear, and the color matches great and is pretty sheer so it blends. 

I should mention I’ve never been the flawless “instagram brows” type, and I have pretty normal thickness, dark blonde brows. So this works great for me to just even them out and fill them in a tiny bit.

Aurora Lights

A little background. I dont have any colourful palettes yet as im just starting to use colour. I was looking for affordable pallettes that are pigmented enough for me not to worry about. (And also ship to australia without huge tax/shipping/conversion rate since i live in australia)
I currently own the modern renaissance, original carli bybel, colourpops you had me at hello, and a few others i dont remember.

Im pretty interested in the fairy lights and ibiza palette. I was wanting to know how the ibiza palette and the take me back to brazil palette compares as they are similar. I know TMBTB is a pressed pigment palette, and has issues with consistency in the pigments but has a great shade range.

To my surprise, it worked great! I have full coverage, but the cheeks are just a bit thin. Running up and down underneath with an the pencil for 20-30 seconds produced an incredibly 'thick' appearance.

I know nothing about make up though, so I don't know if this is bad for my skin, or even safe. I don't want to start doing this everyday and end up regretting it down the line. My question is, are  eyebrow pencils safe to use on the face long term? Is there any risk of skin damage, wrinkles, hair loss etc? When it's on I feel a sort of 'tingle', but I wouldn't describe it as painful or irritating. I've never worn makeup before though, so I don't know if this is normal.

I need a full-coverage foundation bc I have acne/discoloration/shitty skin. 
And I also have combo skin- it’s pretty normal but can get oily especially in the t-zone throughout the day. 

I was using the Laura Mercier hydrating primer together with the Too Faced Born This Way foundation- they went on very well and covered up my imperfections perfectly but throughout the day, my skin would get very oily and it would cake/crease/basically fall off of my skin and it would look very patchy and gross. 

So then I switched the using the Smashbox Oil &amp; Shine Control primer along with the Estée Lauder Double Wear foundation and this has worked amazingly with staying on all day with little-to-no creasing/caking/patchiness BUT when applying, I feel like my skin isn’t oily ENOUGH to get the foundation to blend well- it takes forever, even with using a damp beauty blender. 

(And yes I do moisturize my skin before applying my primer)

Would you recommend it?"

1589117852,Makeup,(Mechanical) Pencils and me,"I'm not a makeup pro but have been using basic stuff for years and I do use make-up every day! I have recently started experimenting with different color eyeliners and pencils. This might sound idiotic but somebody PLEASE explain to me if the mechanical Pencils all twist up/retracts? I purchased several (cheap brand ones) and I haven't been able to push them up once the tip has been used up. I've already looked up some tips and several pages stayed they are ""twist ups"" but maybe the ones I have aren't!? Which seems crazy because there is all this pencil left there has to be something in it, right!? It can't be just the tip (lol). Please help me, I'm bad at this!
The ones I currently have are Nyx Jumbo Eye Pencil (617 Iced Mocha) and L.A. Girl ShockWave Neon Eyeliner. 
I've been wanting to try some from glossier and/or tarte but I think I should ""master"" the way I use them through low quality brands first, before going all in.... And not being able to get past the tip doesn't qualify as ""master"" of pencils...

thanks in advance!

I notice this all the time with lipstick bullets (ie Maybelline does not seal in their lipstick in plastic tamper proof packaging). I also recently bought an Elf concealer but saw that there was product all over the inside of the lid, indicating that someone had taken out the applicator already. Sure, drugstore items usually never have dedicated testers, but this is no excuse to open something up and putting other customers at risk. Anyone else have issues with this?

I’ve watched some videos and read articles and feel so overwhelmed! From what I’m gathering everyone has different essential products so I don’t know where I should start or what products I might need to pair together for them to work out /: 

Would it be okay (as in look alright and enhance my look a bit) if I purchased a BB cream and then a blush and used just that plus whatever mascara and lip balm I have around? From my understanding BB cream would lightly balance out my skin tone and blush bring some colour to my face. Is there anything I’d need to add to those two things to make it work and look like I’ve done something (good), or is that too few products? 

Any advice/suggestions/tips are welcomed and appreciated so much! I would like to tone down some redness/blemishes (bb cream?) without covering them or getting into too many products, as well as adding something to my face (mascara and blush?). I guess I’d like a subtle look I can do with some (as few as possible) products to just even me out a bit and make me look more 🌟 than my usual bare face. TYIA"

1589245593,Makeup,Am I too much of a basic b* to enjoy Pat McGrath eyeshadows?,"When pandemic and subsequent lockdown hit, I started to cultivate a passion for make up or more specifically eyeshadows. (i.e. my skill level in the department is very limited). I found that I enjoyed very much Urban Decay and Fenty Beauty palettes, in their easy breezy colorful qualities.
When I found Pat McGrath and her website, I was mesmerized with her palettes and dropped £800 in one go (bought also glosses and concealer). I noticed the look was a bit more dramatic than what I had come to like but I figure I could tone it down with my application. And the duocromes made my mouth water.
I have been trying for more than two weeks to make these palettes work but I can’t! I always ended up with looks that are too intense yet so boring.
I haven’t found one matte shade I like, the shimmers are so overwhelming and the duocromes don’t really show the duo effect on the lip.
Now I don’t use fancy brushes or use any eyelid primer / concealer but I didn’t have any problems with my cheaper palettes.
Every look with those palettes is either boring or more suitable for going clubbing and I hate the clubs! 

Do you have any tips to make the palettes more enjoyable for me? Should I start applying eye concealer? Get fancy brushes? Work more on my technique? 
I’m kinda of annoyed that those palettes will again require more investment from me but it’s better than to draw all that money down the drain"

Background (Just for the curious, skip it if you want :D): I never wore a lot of makeup. I've just never liked the feeling of it. I ocasstionally wore a little bit but it was never a ton. For the most part, I just go bare. Recently, I made a post on r/amiugly and several people suggested i try doing my makeup. I really want to give it a try. I want to take everyone's advice that they have given me and I want to improve myself and gain confidence in my appearance. I feel like makeup is a good place for me to start out. When I did do my makeup as a teen, I never did any lip coloring because everyone said I looked better without it. As nice as that is to hear, sometimes I just want to find a color that looks decent on me that I can ocasstionally use. 

Question: Nearly all shades look bad on me. I tried taking a picture that shows my lip shape. Everytime I try on lip colors, people usually tell me to wipe it off and go with my natural shade. But I want to try and find at least one shade that would look decent on me. Can anyone give any suggestions on what to try? I think I have a warm skin tone but I'm not 100% sure. My foundation I (rarely) use is Maybelline Fit Me, number 130, color ""Buff Beige"" if that helps any. The lighting on the picture isn't the best."

I'm just really interested in trying more from the brand so I'm open to the powder bronzers too. I'm also a light/medium skin tone.

So if anyone has any info, recommendations, experiences to share I'd appreciate it, because I'm ready to make a purchase and I know everyone here has sold and helpful advice."

1589451807,Makeup,How has your makeup routine changed over the last couple of months?,"Hi everyone! My makeup routine has changed a lot, and now I'm curious about others. 

I've been a full-face gal since high school. Winged eyeliner, full shadow, or bust. Then when I started college I became obsessed with lipstick. For years I wouldn't leave the house without it. 

In late 2019 I started to wear less makeup, mostly because my skin was getting better. And since the lockdown started, I've been rocking a bare face more than ever before. It's still pretty uncomfortable because I don't feel ""ready"" or ""awake"" without makeup, but I've definitely gotten more used to it. 

Anyways, I still prefer to wear makeup. But now I don't really feel pretty in my typical full face. Instead of a wing, I've been opting for a classic twist-up eyeliner smeared with a finger, mascara, blush, eyebrow gel, and Vaseline on my lips. Plus spot concealing. 

Yesterday I did a full face for the first time in a while, but when I got up from my vanity to do my hair in the bathroom, looking at myself was... unsettling? Almost an uncanny valley feeling. My face looked oddly flat despite highlight. And concealing my dark circles made my eyes look really strange. 

Then I noticed how heavy my face felt through the day, and it only got worse as I grew tired. I found myself wanting to wipe off all of my hard work! And I used to love seeing my lipstick prints on cups etc. but now I find it annoying. 

Has anyone else gone through a similar transition? I know it's not that odd but makeup almost used to be part of my identity. Now it's kind of an afterthought."

1589463950,Makeup,How do I navigate foundation names to find the right shade for the undertone of my skin?,"Sometimes there isnt a tester available for a foundation or I'm at a store like walmart where there arent like makeup experts lol. I'm very very new to face makeup (have worn foundation once for halloween but it looked kind of yellow on me), and I've noticed consistencies between brands for names like ""bisque"", ""ivory"", ""beige"", ""nude"" etc. Are those names supposed to indicate if they are cool toned or are brands that unoriginal? I have red undertones and I can never ever find a foundation that I think is a good enough match to wear out and about and not look like a complete knob.

I'm into the drugstore category of makeup; are there any foundation shades in any brands that may fall into the red/cool undertone category? I'm not super pale but I am white, if that helps lol.

TLDR - what do names like ""ivory"" and ""beige"" mean in foundation, and can you make recommendations for a drugstore foundation for white skin that is cool toned?"
1589469867,Makeup,Eyeliner with a tremor - suggestions other than felt-tip eyeliner?,"Hi all, I'd love to be able to do a cateye or other winged eyeliner look, but due to a medication side effect I have a bit of a tremor in my hands and even very slightly in my eyelid when I'm applying makeup. 

I'm pretty unfussy and am always running late, so I'd like to be able to do a quick eyeliner and a bit of mascara in the morning and be done with it. The problem is that with my tremor, I always mess up the liner and have to spend extra time trying to neaten it up or start fresh - and the more work I have to put into it, the worse my tremor gets. 

Are there any techniques you use to help apply your liner better? How about products - I'm currently using a felt tip pen style liner, but I've found that kohl liners and creams are easier to apply and more forgiving - I'm just not sure how to make wings with them.

1586230989,Makeup,Resource for fixing or making makeup,"Not sure if this is the right sub but I wanted to share this with people. I have bought at least 6 shades of foundations in the past 2 months. I was looking for something in the drugstore-brand price range that duped the shade Nars Sheer Glow Khartoum.  Khartoum is a deep shade with a subtle red undertone. I tried 4 Juvia shades, Milani, Rimmel, and a couple others. They are all really good foundations but the shades are missing the hint of red. I ordered another Milani shade just yesterday.

I said all that to say this: I finally thought of buying some shade adjusting drops. Until I saw the prices. Also, I didn't see anything to *add* red hints - just stuff to remove that. Then I remembered where I have gotten some other makeup ingredients from in the past. Bingo! Making Cosmetics is a place for anyone wanting to buy base ingredients for hair, skin and makeup products. I found them a few years back when I wanted to buy something to ""blur"" my pores. I found their product called, get this, ""Wrinkle Blur"" and have used it since. I went back over to see what they had to help finetune the foundations I have. I have ordered a couple of their liquid colorants (Iron Oxide Brown and Iron Oxide Red) and a Mica pigment (Blackstar Red). Here's the best thing, I was able to order in amounts as small as a teaspoon of each item. 

I thought some of you ladies would like to know about M.C. You can even come up with your own makeup and they will help with formulation and packaging. Speaking of, you can order all kinds of tubes and containers for your stuff. 

Hope this helps someone else out there. And, no, I am not paid or an employee! I don't even get referral compensation. I just know that I wish someone had told me about them. I found them on Amazon the first time and then just looked up their website. Prices are good. Shipping is not expensive but I recommend ordering everything you want in one go. I was going to go back and get some large tubes with the dispensing top and my order already shipped so I don't want to pay 5 dollars or more to ship a couple of tubes that cost around a buck fifty each.

I will try to remember to come back and update when I start working on my foundation fixes. DM me if you want to check out my blog where I did a lot of posts about my adventures in looking for a foundation! It was a mess."

So I haven't tried a Mac foundation in literal years (in fact, I can't even remember buying something from Mac recently, even though I was a fan when I started out with makeup). I want to look into the Mac Face &amp; Body foundation, however, as I'm looking for something that will have a nice skin-like effect and is not too heavy. When I enter different foundations that work for me in Findation, I get different outcomes though .. Either C2 or N2. I'm not completely sure for which one to go - especially taking into account that hopefully the weather will stay this nice and I'll get a little bit of colour on my face (from sitting in the garden, haha, not from going out or going on vacation).

**Are there any experts who could tell me the difference between C2 and N2 a bite more comprehensive than what's on Mac's website?**

For your information: I have a bit of an olive undertone, with fairly pink cheeks but more yellow-ey around my forehead. I am quite pale in the winter months, but tan easily. And if this helps, these are some products that I already own\* or have used in the past:

* \*Hourglass Vanish Stick in Shell (autumn/winter shade, can still use it by warming it up with bronzer)
* \*Natasha Denona Sheer Glow in 20 light beige (bit too warm but it's very light coverage so sheers out and makes me look a bit more alive actually)
* Estee Lauder Water foundation in shade Desert Beige
* It Cosmetics CC cream in the shade light (summer shade; could possible use light/medium if I really tan)
* \*Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk in 4.5 (summer shade)
* Charlotte Tilbury Light Wonder 3 (4.5 in summer)

Thanks ☺️"

1586385551,Makeup,Love-hate relationship with Wet n Wild eyeshadow palettes,"When I got back to doing makeup, I purchased two of the Wet n Wild Coloricon eyeshadow palettes along with their Mega Protein mascara. The store that I was at only had Wet n Wild and Rimmel London, so I barely had any options. I tried out the products that I purchased and I liked them. They weren't the best but they weren't the worst either. This was back around in November or December. Fast forward to now and I'm still deciding if I should keep using the eyeshadow palettes until they expire, or just get rid of them for another palette.

I say this because I've been trying to use products that are cruelty free and/or vegan. When I found out that the brand wasn't cruelty-free anymore, I was surprised and also confused. The palettes that I own have a bunny logo on it, indicating that it's cruelty free. I had already thrown out my mascara simply it was already around three months old since I opened it. Personally, I don't like using a product until it's all gone. I am aware that it's wasteful, but I don't want to risk having harmful bacteria (especially on my eyes).

1586398659,Makeup,Natasha Denona Metropolis vs. Gold or Star Palettes,"Hi guys. I was wondering if any of you had thoughts on the ND Metropolis vs. Gold vs. Star palettes in terms of undertones and what would work best for me.

I am an NC30, neutral-cool olive undertone with dark hair and dark eyes and contrast between hair + eyes / and face. When I was younger, I was told I was a winter colouring and should avoid ""grungy"" type looks or very earthy colours because they would wash me out. That's generally been true. I cannot pull off orange very well or any of the fun muddier colours (e.g. ND Born to Run). I really liked ND Metropolis because of the golds and jewel tones but after watching a million reviews, seems to have a lot of those earthy colours - oranges, muddier greens, deeper olive colours that I do not think would work well for me.

I have a giftcard to Sephora and did want to get an ND palette. I was torn between Gold vs. Star. I am not sure if Gold is similar with that grungy type look (e.g. Naked Honey) and Star seems like a good mix but I've heard mixed things. I have a palette similar to Biba so don't want to get that, and Safari seems beautiful but I don't know if I could pull it off (ie. muted muddier colours).   


Any suggestions would be awesome

Maybe this is more a psychological issue, because if I use mascara I need the lashes to be perfectly nice and separated. Otherwise I just get really upset because I'm wasting way too much time doing my makeup and may even cry and remove everything from my eyes.

So I just gave up. No more mascara for me. I may apply a little bit of black pencil to make my lash line look fuller but that's it. I focus mainly on my skin and lips.

* Ballet (seashell pink metallic)
* Dusty Rose (described as a ""dusty lilac,"" but it's more taupe with a hint of purple; matte)

I was excited about these singles because I hate buying palettes with colors I never use, and I was wanting to live my pink and purple unicorn fantasy eyeshadow life. (Dusty Rose kind of messed that up, but it's still a nice color.)

 I'm sensitive to talc, and it's difficult to find talc-free eyeshadow, so I jumped on this chance to get a much loved eyeshadow formula that happened to have no talc!

Anyway, I don't understand the hype ? These shadows look way better swatched on my arm than on my actual lids. They're a powdery mess, and the staying power is abysmal, even with primer.

I used Dusty Rose with a Too Faced palette of mine, and the difference in quality was immediately obvious. The ABH shadows are *so hard* to work with, and the Too Faced shades went on super easy and pigmented in comparison.

In trying to work with the ABH shadows exclusively, the colors become muddy and fade very quickly.

Any advice on how to make these work? A specific eyeshadow primer that works well with ABH shadows?"

I have extremely dry skin all over but it's not textured and I don't struggle with acne. I have a great skincare routine which I'm pretty strict on. I exfoliate every 3 days or so.

The issue is, for work, I am a nurse in a hospital with cold AC on all day which dries my skin out horribly.

But I start work at 7am mostly and like to look a little awake. So I've been using:

* General skincare routine w hydrating serum, moisturiser, oil.
* Sukin Tinted Sunscreen (As a base)
* Maybelline fit me concealer on redness/blemishes
* Essence clear brow gel

And that's all I do, just to take my redness from eczema. The issue is, like 5 hours into my shift it starts to flake horribly around my chin and above my lips, on dry spots.

What can I do differently?

The areas around my eyes are also so horribly dry that I don't try to apply concealer to them.

Will a setting spray fix this? Should I be using a primer? Going to start including a highlighter and cream blush.

Thanks!"

Well I don’t know what happened but lately I am loving the more glowy look. I think my skin changed to combo and I can get away with more dew now. I also love how youthful and fresh it can look if done right. I have completely stopped using powders (except blush, it’s in powder form) and only rely on glowy primer, concealer and blush. It pulls a very natural, radiant look.

What look do you prefer?"

1586752272,Makeup,"sos, smashbox liquid lipstick is drier than my dms during quarantine.","I bought “bawse” always on liquid lipstick from smashbox sometime in the past 6 months and got maybe a good 5-6 uses out of it before it dried out so much the product consistency has completely changed. I fell in love with this liquid lip when I was at Ulta and decided to splurge a little because I’m a sucker for a bold, matte red lip (the color I always used before for years is MAC ruby woo) and I wanted to try out a liquid lip. I noticed a month or so ago when I used it that it had dried out a little. Now it’s almost unusable. I looked around a little bit to try to see how long they’re supposed to last once opened. I know I can add things to it to rescue it, but it just seems crazy to me that this product would be unusable after a few months whereas my colourpop liquid lip (the only other one I have) is older and still going strong.

Turns out my sister went through her collection this week as well and had to cull “Dream huge” by smashbox as well (also their liquid matte lip color). I’m not sure how long she had it but it’s even drier than mine.

I had always heard such good things about smashbox and I only recently started branching out with buying makeup so I guess this was a beginner’s mistake. There are loads of reviews on this on their website about the fact that their packaging somehow converts their liquid lip products into the Sahara after a couple of months, but I always check reddit when I buy something now so I wanted to add this feedback here for anybody who might look for recent feedback on products here like me. 

Anyway, anybody out there got a good replacement for smashbox’s bawse in a liquid lip? Open to suggestions"

I'll go first: I really dislike Context beauty lip lacquer. I got it in a makeup subscription and it is so sticky. It was so sticky, I cannot stress this enough. And I like a good gloss, but what even happened here?? It was the worst sensation to put on, the most boring color (almost my exact lip color), and the disappointment was so great that whenever I see a product of theirs, I assume it's bad. I just saw a product that could have been perfectly decent, and I just imagined it having the texture of elmers glue and chalk."

When I was a young teen, I was obsessed with makeup but in my later teen years the obsession sort of went stale and at 25, I feel entirely out of the loop. I've been working on an everyday makeup routine, but there a few things that I'm lacking. I've found higher-end versions of what I want, but they're sort of out of my budget at the moment, so I was wondering if anybody knew of any good dupes (that are available in the UK). 

I desperately need a setting powder, I don't have one at all. I tried the Hourglass Ambient Lighting powders before and loved them! I was wondering if anybody knew of any cheaper alternatives?

In terms of contour, I find that cream products are much easier for me to use. I used to use the cream version of Benefit's Hoola, but I can't find that anymore? Does anybody know of anything similar. 

Also, I was wondering if anybody knew of any similar colour dupes to Charlotte Tilbury's pillow talk lipstick and liner. 

Any recommendations will be hugely appreciated. 

Thanks so much."

In fact, it made me look more wrinkly than with nothing at all (turning 40 this year). I put on Cerave am moisturizer before applying the bare minerals (in the color fairly medium), and Benefit erase paste for under eye bags.  It all settled in and made my face look super dry and settled into my fine lines and accentuated them. I’m pretty far out of the makeup loop, and have no idea what to look for that would suit me better.  I’m hoping that maybe someone here can help steer me in the right direction. I don’t want anything super fancy or expensive. I’ve liked MAC brand in the past.

I was so excited to try this foundation, especially after seeing tons of good reviews on it. Ive been wanting to try something different then my normal matte foundation (I’ve been using the Too Faced Peach Perfect Matte foundation for the past year) and lately I’ve been wanting to find a foundation that might be more of a satin finish. I find that as I’m getting older a super heavy matte look just isn’t as flattering. Anyway, after trying this several times with two different primers (Too Faced peach perfection matte fig primer and The silk canvas by Tatacha) this seriously starts sliding off my skin within an hour, that’s even after setting it with powder and setting spray. It settles into my lines, slides and removes even just to the touch, gets caked on my cheeks, just overall looks sooo bad. I really had a hard time finding anyone with a similar experience? Any feedback on if this is something others have experienced or any tips on how to make this foundation work? It’s so expensive so I would like to give it a fair chance!

1586851672,Makeup,can't get mascara off,"This happens with ANY mascara I use. I've used probably 10+ different brands and wasted so much money hoping to find one that would work for me. Most of them aren't even waterproof.

I soak cottonballs in oil and/or eye makeup remover (tried both) and let it soak on my eyes for 2-3 minutes. The mascara still doesn't come off. The ONLY way it will even start to come off is if I take a soaked cotton round and just literally pull it off my lashes. Obviously this is extremely damaging to my lashes and I don't even have many left because they get pulled out. It takes 15+ minutes of scrubbing like this to get MOST of the mascara off (there's always still remnants, I've gone at it for 20 minutes at times)  and leaves my eyes in pain and losing a lot of lashes.

I've stopped wearing mascara altogether because I just can't deal with it anymore but I have blonde lashes so my makeup looks really stupid if I skip mascara. I've thought about eyelash extensions but can't afford it right now.

I recently ran out of primer so I bought more at Ulta because I thought I liked it. I recently started mixing in Fenty foundation with my Huda (and using the new primer) and that’s when my upper lip started sweating. Sometimes so bad that my makeup would be gone halfway through the day as I was wiping it away all day. Like literal pools of sweat on my lip 

I have tried not using the Fenty with it and it still happened. I used a new primer today, the MM Hydro Grip (which is amazing by the way, total game changer)  but I can feel the sweating not too far away. Nothing showing though

So my question - does anyone know what causes this? It’s so weird feeling and makes me super self conscious. Thanks guys!!"

I work in direct sunlight for 8hrs and I feel like there's no use for makeup because it literally melts off of me. Usually halfway through the day I look in the mirror to find my foundation melted off and you can clearly see where my concealer is, if that makes sense? After going through different brands I decided that I should just try a bb/cc cream. I just want something that evens out my skin tone, maybe something with spf, that also wont completely melt off. Anyone have any suggestions? I'm really not concerned with coverage, I just look so bad with how blotchy my skin naturally looks because of old acne scars and redness. 

I was looking at sun shield liquid SPF 50 by Mychelle and kosås tinted face oil. Leaning more for kosas but wasn't sure since that was oil based."

I was excited to see the product upon opening the box, bright colors are my thing and you know what I love some neon eyeliner. But I put to much force into opening the pink one and accidentally snapped the tip of the makeup right off. Originally I thought hey, no problem I'll just sharpen it off...


There doesn't look like a way to sharpen it off.

The end of the barrel doesn't twist to extend the product inside, it's plastic so a pencil sharpener is dangerous to the sharpener at best, there weren't instructions on the package and I can find no review of the stuff beyond comments about the colors on the seller's website.

Am I just stupid and missed the solution entirely or is this a known thing with this product?

Now whenever I feel like putting on liner I just do the wing on the outside corner with liquid, and maybe if I really feel fancy I do a very thin lash line with the cream one (though that's rarer since the hooded side is more obvious than the mono, and it doesn't look even unless I put it on thick, which looks wonky). You can't really see it if I do the lash line anyway, so I just don't bother. Does primer help significantly with this? Or is it the type of liner? Thanks. :)"

My mom got an e.l.f. cream contour kit and without even trying it just gave it to me. I tried some YouTube videos but I was wondering if anyone here could help me understand some things. 

1. Is there just a basic technique any face shape can use or do you need to understand your face shape while knowing what outcome you're looking for to GET the proper results? 

2. Only part of my face I'm interested in shaping up is my nose, I already use highlighter otherwise I'm lost on the proper use of shadows. But do I need to do my whole face to bring the look together?

3. Do you need a perfect match on colors? My mom's got more native american while im... Pinker? Lol I'm not sure if there's just a basic color pallette or if it's almost ""colors fit most skin tones""? 

4. Now that I own primer, liquid foundation, cream contour, powder highlighter, blush, eyebrow powder, eyeliner, eyeshadow, eyeshadow primer, mascara what is the easiest or proper order I should apply the stuff? 

I like to watch murder makeup Mondays that YouTuber Bailey sarian does so I've watched her do this a lot but I'm still LOST and would just love to ask people their routine!

I wanted to practice with good products because I want to become a MUA in the future, but I'm really on the verge of giving up because I can't find the right products for me to practice.

Part of it is probably because in most their photos their hairstyle is strange, like it doesn't even seem to suit them but they still rock with it and other reason is I guess the different colour makeup they've applied rather then what they had in the film where they looked really attractive.

1583811838,Makeup,[Product Advice] Mac Face And Body Foundation,"I've seen a lot of people raving about this being a nice sheer, light coverage foundation. So it has really piqued my interest since this is my ideal coverage.

I don't have a Mac store within range of me so would need to order online (never a fan of this with foundation) and haven't been able to figure out the shade that's best for me yet so naturally I've been checking online swatches as well as watching a number of videos. This is where I got really confused, everywhere it says it is a *water based* foundation...yet dimethicone is second on the ingredient list AND everywhere it seems again, it is said to ***never** use it with a silicone based primer (which I prefer personally), but again this doesn't make any sense to me at all?

I take Mac up on their online certified MUA contact email and ask a few questions about shade advice, as well as the water vs silicone thing. Oddly I receive a very detailed reply to everything but then she said, *""I should not comment on the ingredients nor recommend a primer to you but here is Consumer Relations email to ask them...""* which I found strange. I email the link and they get back to me with, ""We feel it would be better to discuss this over the phone with you as our ingredient list can be complicated, please call [phone number].*"" This too is strange to me, I just want to buy your foundation with a pretty straight-forward question, I'm not new to make-up and this isn't a complicated question to me and why does it feel they're being careful not to put this in writing, but ok. I call the number and ask my question and get put on hold, transferred 3 times after repeating the same and then was left on hold for 40 minutes when I finally lost my patience and hung up. My interest is fading at this point but so many seem to just love it. 

So, this brings me here to those who have or do use it and can offer any input as to why it is sold as a water based foundation, MUA videos saying the same, but has a silicone so high on the list, and if you use a water or silicone primer with it? (Any insight on the weirdness from Mac as well if others have possibly encountered anything similar, which I still find so very odd tbh.)"

When I went to use the golden glimmer shade (I can't remember the name off the top of my head....Sworn Enemy?) When I went to use it, my brush was not picking up much of the shade. I did the trick where you spray your brush with setting spray beforehand, as well. Now it looks like there's a huge dent in that shade and I feel like that was a horrible idea from my end.

I've been using fenty beauty, or Estee Lauders double wear foundation and of course they are glass bottles. Perfect up until the point where fentys no longer pumps anymore or nothing left to drip out of Estee. Then I'm left trying to twirl my pinky around and Jimmy rig a contraption to get the rest out. Theres at least enough left overs for a few more applications. And then there's god forsaken build up around the neck of the bottle that no matter how hard I try I'll never get LOL
Maybe I'm doing it wrong I dont know but its frustrating because I'm not about to throw away something I already spent an arm and a leg for. 

Sure I can just switch to a different foundation with an easier to access bottle but I've always had trouble finding the right one and when I finally worked up the courage to try these two they were like the holy grail for my skin! Hard to pass that up and start a forever long money pit of a  journey to the right foundation again.

I am looking for:

-a tinted brow gel product: I have full hair brows but need something to hold them in shape mostly. I would like some tint to fill in slightly. I usually use a dark blonde/light brown NYX brow pencil and skip brows a lot lately because they look so... heavy. 

-under eye concealer: maybe a color corrector would help here, but I have some darkness under my eyes that I would like to brighten up. I was using a maybelline wand concealer but it wasn’t amazing and I haven’t been able to find it lately in stores. 

-foundation: I’ve been using Estée Lauder double wear for years because my skin liked it, the coverage is so great, and it lasts. I’m curious about the double wear light, maybe? I want something that’s not so... flat. I still need some coverage. 

Or maybe a primer would help with the look I’m going for? 

-primer: something pore filling around my nose, and maybe something illuminating? 

-blush and bronzer: I’ve been using physicians formula butter bronzer and Milani luminoso blush. Yes those are the only products I have lol. Hit me with any other drugstore price point recs.

Yeah, it’s a cute idea but I think if most of these collections did not have the cute packaging that makes us feel nostalgic, we would not buy the product. Not always but sometimes. The products are usually somewhat simple and something we already have in our collection. However, we get so excited about the packaging that we are automatically like, “OMG. MOVE ASIDE. I NEED THIS RIGHT NOW!!!!!”. Which there is so thing wrong with that either. It’s your money, so what you want.

I guess I just feel like it’s kind of lazy on the brands because they know that people will buy it simply for the packaging (again, there is nothing wrong with this) and they could put less effort and creativity in the products themselves. I don’t know. Just a thought.

I would really like to hear what you guys think and see if you have any opinions on this topic. I am not trying to fight with anyone. If you want to buy something for the cute packaging only, you are a grown adult and you can do whatever you want with your money but I just wanna see if anyone feels the same way or what people’s thoughts are in general."

My hands and head look like they've never seen the sun while the outer part of my arms (because the inner part lives in permanently overcast weather) apparently are on a regular tropical vacation.
There's no possible shade match that I can figure out. I just don't wear foundation and fuck it.

I went to Mecca Maxima and got colour matched for a tinted BB cream and took a sample pot home. I had initially thought that the texture/feel in store was from the way the lady applied it to my face and that I would try a thinner application at home, but it would appear the look is just, part of it?
Is there something I should be doing that I’m not aware of? I find it goes clumpy/separates around my nose and literally melts from my forehead with any rise in temp as well, which is a real deal-breaker.
             
I do use a matte Primer after cleansing and allow it to set before applying anything else, I use seperate brushes to apply all products (I recently had surgery to give me back sensation in my hands, I have very little fingertip pressure finesse at times).

Can I just go without foundation? I find powders sit nicely on my skin and don’t seperate/clump or slough when I go outside."

1583976048,Makeup,"Liquid concealer ""Palette"" in Squeeze Tubes, or single-serving packets?","So, I'm looking for a specific thing. I don't even know it exists. The last time I wore makeup was grease paint as a kid on Halloween over twenty years ago. Pretty much all I know is stuff I've overheard, or learned while researching this project.

I'm a photographer. Most of my clients don't want a makeup artist, and so sometimes show up with a blemish that they're real self-conscious about. I can totally airbrush it out later, but that doesn't help them feel confident *now*, so I'm thinking of putting together an emergency kit. As part of that, I'll need concealer.

I need a variety of tones, so a palette sounds ideal, but for sanitary reasons I would rather have a a liquid in squeeze tubes, so I can just give them a dab on a disposable applicator. I know, unnecessary waste, but it's very sanitary and my clients will be confident it's sanitary. I could just get a selection of tubes, but a single quarter ounce tube would last *years* for this, having several would just be ridiculous.

Is there a palette or sampler kit or something like that of liquid concealers? Or maybe concealer of any kind that I can get in sealed, single-use packages so my client knows it's sanitary? 

It doesn't need to be super-high quality. It only needs to last an hour, and if it's an imperfect match or not concealing enough in a way that shows in the photos, I can always airbrush it anyway. I just need something ""good enough"" that I can have on-hand in case of emergency."

I tried the boscia first time and my whole face had white marks that I couldn't take off. I was pissed and thought I had bought a bad item. I researched it and learned I needed to properly shake it to ensure the charcoal was distributed. I  tried it again after shaking it rigorously and my makeup is so matte.

I’ve tried several foundations since my skin changed: 
UD All Nighter, Tarte Amazonian Clay, L’Oréal true match, Physicians Formula CC Cream, L’Oréal pro glow, Tarte Face Tape (I’m currently using) 

I’ve also tried a few different silicone based and hydrating primers. 

I don’t necessarily need full coverage but I would like to even put my skin tone/cover redness and cover/minimize my scars.."

1584232640,Makeup,Starting back at ZERO,"So life has been a spiral for the last year and my love for makeup had to be put on the back burner due to many reasons including financial and basically removed myself from communities to dodge temptation.

Only now I'm back and a huge pile of problems so to try and combat them without emptying my bank account I figured I would post here in hopes for some advice and/or product suggestions.

The main things I battle with:
1. I'm pale af, like I'm normally around the porcelain shade range and I have a neutral undertone so it makes finding a foundation incredibly hard. Currently everything I have is expired other than the lightest tinted moisturizer I could find at CVS and it's too dark.

2. I sweat a lot and have hot flashes so most of the time my makeup is gone by mid day, my waterproof mascara is smudged to hell and back and concealer is nowhere to be seen. Nothing stays put for long unless it's winter and it's about to start summer in Alabama and it's not only hot but humid as well.

3. Along my jawline on my cheeks gets red so it makes it look like no matter what I do my foundation doesn't match. I've tried green tint primers but I don't see much of a difference.

4. I have dry skin so Matte finish can make me look flaky and matte is ""in"" so it's hard to find something that looks good on me.

Those are the main 4 issues and I'm not even sure where to start. If anyone has any ride or dies that combat these I would love to hear them."

Should I switch to all cream products? Is there a powder that won't make me look powdery? I've been using Hourglass loose powder for a year or so and loved it. This is just so weird to me, I've never had problems with make up application. I could do a full face in minutes before this.

I walk in and walk around. I see a couple of workers and head to the Estée Lauder counter. No one’s there and that’s fine. I look at the shades and a lady that works in the beauty dept yells at me “can I help you?”. She was about ten steps away, but made her way closer to me. 

I was happy to get help, because I’m terrible at shade matching. She tells me, “No, I can’t help you because they all left.” I was confused, but okay. I ask for samples to be made if they make them, because I might have an idea on what my shade could be. She said, “We do have samples, but no I can’t make any for you.” I drop it and attempt to shade match myself. I do this by just opening the clearly marked tester. Looking into the shade and I get cut off by her looking disgusted at me. She said, “please don’t touch that. Your fingers have oil.” And I felt really bad. I set it down right away and apologized profusely. She said “it’s okay, now you know.” I’m confused. Are consumers not allowed to touch testers?

I wait for about 10-15 mins to let them set in. After that, I wet my blender and put some concealer stick based on a concealer map (?) I've seen before. Usually, I do the upside down triangle thingy on the undereyes for about 12 times on each eye and yikes... it does the work but is that too much after all? It looks fine to me but after I use some powder to set it, it just gets really patchy all of a sudden. Might have to do with the powder itself or the fact I use a brush so I'll have to try out some other techniques, maybe? But what's been bothering me all along is my concealer. I don't know how to phrase this, but my mom just gave it to me saying no matter what the user's skintone is, the concealer's just gonna adjust to that???? Like their concealer's only got one shade??? I'm not really sure though. It's just a drugstore product so should I go ahead and look for alternatives? Should I add in some foundation too? Anyone who can help? :("

I am a princess performer (I go to children's birthday parties and entertain) and I wear a full coverage everything and all my makeup is very extra (think drag queen).

1581269347,Makeup,Heated eyelash curlers VS. Shu Uemura or Shiseido eyelash curler?,"So Shu Uemura and Shiseido eyelash curlers are among the ultimate for many makeup users.  

Many of us believe that these two Japanese eye lash curlers couldn’t be more different from their western counterparts in delivering results, lasting all day long, like magic on the lashes.

So those of you who have tired one or both of these eye lash curlers but have ALSO tried heated eye lash curlers, how do they compare?

Which did you prefer? 
Why? 
How long do they last in comparison to each other? 
In which ways do the results differ in heated VS  Shu/Shiseido? 
Did you notice any lash fall out with the heated curler that you wouldn’t have had otherwise? (be honest)

Be sure to mention which heated lash curler you used. 

Thanks so much! Looking forward to the insight!"

1581273900,Makeup,Are we living in a lie? (NYX&amp;L'oreal),"I was looking at NYX cosmetics website and at the bottom it says it's being run by l'oreal, I know NYX claim to be cruelty free but l'oreal for sure isn't and they do test on animals. So what they just made a smaller company to appeal to younger costumers and when we spend money on their products we still contribute to animal testing and cruelty? That's upsetting. I like NYX makeup a lot but I feel like they mislead their costumers. 
This is nothing new btw, there's a ton of misleading in mass appeal since the day it first started, like I read about how urban outfitters is run by a homophobic right winged old white man. 
Or how dolls kill is trying to appear as women empowering but until not long ago all their models were so thin they looked like they only smell food. 
Still even though it's nothing new, for those who care for the hopping bunny tag, it's pretty fucked up to do this. Some of us care to know our money isn't being spent on caging animals and torture."

I have been trying to figure out my undertone for a long time. Almost every foundation I tried wasn’t a good match, too pink too orange, etc... Almost everything cool or neutral was too pink and everything warm was too orange (as far as I can remember lol.) When I found this subreddit I tried many of the recommended foundation shades. Although I’m still not sure if I found my “perfect” match, those foundations matched me better than anything I previously tried. I’m not sure if I am olive, muted, cool yellow, etc... Maybe a different undertone entirely. 

I have rosacea which makes my cheeks red, sometimes more so than others. For that reason these pictures focus mostly on my neck/chest area. I find my undertone shows better in that area anyways. I also think that whenever I am tan my undertone is more prominent. In the summer I tan easily and don’t usually burn. If I do burn, it’s usually just the first time I tan. My veins in my arm are a blueish green color. I have a burnt orange/rusty red sweater that I get compliments saying it “looks good with my skin tone” when I’m wearing it. Not sure if that is helpful lol. 

Here are a ton of photos which will hopefully help determine my undertone:

[My arm compared to my brother’s](https://imgur.com/a/lRNNdF0)

[Photos of my neck/chest](https://imgur.com/a/2bUzanX) These were taken throughout the past year or so, so I am more tan in some than others. In most of these photos I am not wearing foundation. If I seem to have foundation on, it is most likely either Urban Decay 30CG or NYX Vanilla Nude. 

[15 foundations and 6 concealers swatched on neck/chest](https://imgur.com/a/h6OlYQm)
Foundations are grouped in 3, concealers are all in one photo. I took two pictures of each set of foundations. One in a darker spot in my room, another closer to a window with filtered light. All of these were taken today and I am super pale now that it’s winter, so some foundations will be too dark. The Cover FX power play foundation was still a bit too dark at my tannest last summer.

I always heard that you’re not supposed to use mascara with lash extensions.

Well then, what about the makeup product (concealer, powders, eyeshadows, etc.) that coat your eyelashes like a dust? We normally use mascara to take care of that after we’re done with everything, and darken them to a normal colour again. 

So what do people who use lash extensions do since they’re not allowed to wear mascara?

Thanks :)"

1581527928,Makeup,Is it my skin barrier or the makeup I am using causing immediate breakouts?,"I am having a dilemma figuring out what to do about my skin. I really don't wear much makeup as I am trying to clear up my acne. On January 17th I got a medium strength chemical peel, had absolutely no reactions whatsoever. About 9 days later, my husband wanted to take me on a date so I put some makeup on. Washed my face that night, next morning woke up with 1-2 breakouts nothing major. Next morning woke up to a face full of breakouts. And the next morning it was even worse. My forehead was all broken out and burned and was itchy. I thought I had a folliculitis outbreak because I have had them before. It ended up clearing up. And then I put makeup on again Saturday and it did the SAME THING! Itchy burning forehead and a bunch of whiteheads all around my mouth like 3 hours after putting the makeup on. I had to leave my event to go home and wash my face. My breakouts are just red scars now but my forehead is still burning? I have so many events coming up and would rather not go bare faced :(

First time I wore Makeup I wore: (None of this was fungal acne safe)

\-Baby face primer

\-Infallible Pro Glow Foundation

\-Maybelline Blush

\-Becca Highlighter

and that was it...

The second time I used: (all of this is fungal acne safe)

\-NYX Hydrating Primer

\-Supergood CC Cream

\-Maybelline 24 Hour Stay Foundation in some spots I needed more coverage

\-NYX Hydrating Setting Spray

I have never had a reaction like this to makeup. yes, I have broken out almost everytime I wear makeup but nothing this bad. I feel like I have a mild case of type 2 rosacea and that may be the case? but I haven't been tested by a doctor but I am just unsure what to do.

I am looking into getting the Bare Minerals Complexion Rescue Gel Cream as the ratings on COSDNA are great. Has this happened to anyone and could help me? I really want my makeup back!!"

For reference, my foundation/concealer matches are Mac Face and Body N3, Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Wear in 230 Buff W, Tarte Shape Tape in Light-Medium Sand, and Glossier Stretch Concealer in G8. 


The lipsticks I own at the moment are: 

Mac Ruby Woo

Mac Russian Red 

Mac Viva Glam 1 

Mac Midimauve

Mac Creme In Your Coffee

Mac Feels So Grand 

Lisa Eldridge Velvet Ribbon 

Fenty Lip Paint in Uncensored 

Fenty Gloss Bomb in Glass Slipper 

Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey

Revlon Super Lustrous Shine in Nude Illuminator

Glossier Balm Dot Com in Cherry 

Glossier Balm Dot Com in Berry 


I prefer matte opaque reds, but otherwise I would much rather have a glossy sheer wash of color, but glossiness is more important than it being sheer. I don’t like light nudes or bright “ fun “ shades on myself. 

My favorites from my collection are Clinique Black Honey, Revlon Nude Illuminator, Mac Ruby Woo and Fenty Uncensored. 


Looking forward to reading all your  recommendations! Thank you all in advance."

I sent them an email and they said “No need to worry, there's nothing wrong. To ensure our products are hypoallergenic and safe for your skin, we use a special blend of ingredients. Because of its consistency, it may need to be stirred when it arrives, as it may naturally separate.”

1581754118,Makeup,Foundations for being under showroom light,"I'll start with the fact that I am 25 and for the first time ever looking to get a foundation that isn't drug store or bargain bin grade. I know very minimal about what I actually need because I'm not a huge make up junkie. 

I recently took a job that has me on an interior design show room floor, which is flooded with super bright light from tons of angles. The entire store front is massive windows that let in loads of natural light, the ceiling is loaded with super bright florescents, and then throughout the aisles there are warmer tone track lighting and spot lights. I am on my feet, carrying displays, and moving around all day, so I feel like I'm producing a bit more oils and occasionally breaking a little sweat, but I need to look good as a primary design consultant (clients don't wanna work with the sweaty girl that's got patchy make up lol). I do not have any opportunities to touch up throughout the day, so I need something that's going to stick 8-10 hours. Do y'all have recommendations on what's going to look good all day under super bright lights? 

Maybe helpful info about my skin? It has SUPER pink/red undertones, otherwise very light/porcelain. Some very red hyperpigmentation from old acne scarring.

I have freckles all over me and mainly my face. I enjoy wearing makeup, but I enjoy showing off my freckles so I don’t like to use a standard foundation. However, my biggest problem is I have pimples around my mouth/chin area, so it looks odd to have it full coverage there but then every where else normal

I was wondering about a good concealer/ powder combination or even skin care. Skin is combination

I have fairly large pores on my nose and one pore in particular was damaged and enlarged during my teens from a bad pimple.  I've ""unprofessionally/improperly messed"" with it over the years and have made it worse.  

The result is a decent size and very noticeable hole in my nose.

What is the easiest and best option for me to quickly cover/hide/fill the hole every morning?    

Much of what I read online about hiding acne scars is advice geared to one step in a full makeup routing.  I don't wear makeup, so I need a unique, ""one step"" solution.

I have fair skin and have the means to pay for whatever the best solution is.

So, I got the new Urban Decay Stay Foundation and I have been having trouble with it. When I put it on, I put dots around my face with the foundation. Then I brush it in with a makeup brush. I see the foundation dries quickly and leaves strikes. The biggest thing I hate is my skin is dry at the moment and shows all the dry flaky skin at the moment. \*Gross\* I like the matte look of the makeup and how it does not get oily over the day of use. Which is something I am looking for in a product and this is the first one that works. but I can't stand the dry flake skin showing and the strikes. 

(Before I apply, I put a light layer of moisturizer (Image skin vital c) and Laura Mercier Foundation Primer, Blemish-less)

Am i applying it wrong? Is there a better way to apply this makeup? This there a better makeup foundation for my skin and needs (doesn't get oily over the day and matte look). Do I need something else to help solve this issue?

I am open to recommendations

FYI: I am very acne-prone, sensitive skin, the combo of oily and dry. (Overall I am a mess) lol

I’ve improved since I’ve gotten better quality products and brushes but some things are still the same. 

My eyeshadow is always different on one eye compared to the other. On top of that my eyelids are hooded and sometimes I’m at a loss on what to do. I watch tutorials but I can’t master anything.  I don’t have all the products I want because from my perspective, it’s too costly for something I can’t use properly.

1578476078,Makeup,Oily skinned people - what powder foundations do you wear that keeps you matte and NOT cakey?,"First off, I have a good skincare routine, so my skin isn't dehydrated. I have oily-combination skin, inherited from my mother. I got large pores (often cover with primer), dark circles and a slightly red nose.   
My absolutely-minimal makeup routine for everyday/work is concealer under my eyes and on my nose, bronzer, eyebrows and mascara.  
This works OK, but without powder my face is a bit sticky all day, and concealer sometimes gets dissolved by the natural oils in my skin. And if I powder without foundation underneath, my skin looks oddly matte and I just look unhealthy. Also, the powder will get cakey either straight away or during the day when the oil mixes directly with the powder. It's also impossible to re-apply just powder during the day if my skin gets too oily...

I don't have time for foundation/other base + powder (when I powder I have to use a puff to set it properly), and this takes too long in the morning when I also have to do brows, cheeks and mascara, after a 4-5 step skincare regimen.  


I am hoping a powder foundation will solve my problems."

I went in completely blank, and an employee walked me through a couple different types of foundation. We settled on Lancome’s Teint Idole Ultra Wear. I like the texture and how it felt on my skin. She tried a couple shades on me until she found one she was satisfied with, and it looked ok (for my untrained eye lol). 

The problem came on my way home, i looked down on my hand and relalised the shade that ended up on my face was extremely dark on my hand. Ok i thought, my face must be a bit darker than my hands. But when i came home and looked in the mirror it was A LOT darker than my neck and ears. It was a bit expensive so i was a little irritated, how didnt she see the stark difference in shade?? 

I put it away and decided id wasted my money. A couple days later i decided to try it again and realised it was a perfect match, but when it was mixed into my skin it darkened significantly. 
Is this normal? Is thats whats supposed to happen? Does it react to the heat on my skin? If so, isnt that something the people working there knows about? Again, im new to this kind of makeup and just need some answers, ive moved away from that city so i cant go back there and ask.

1578586387,Makeup,How to start getting into makeup?,"I’m a 19 year-old brown girl and I surprisingly don’t know much about makeup.

My mom was super about being “all-natural” &amp; played into the misconception that makeup was mostly about wanting to impress others (mostly boys), that makeup should only be for a few special occasions &amp; that I should focus more on my education. Hence, growing up, I never really had much makeup at my house &amp; never learned how to use it. My mom used a little makeup when going out, but she has a completely different skin tone &amp; sticks to the basics (minimum foundation, eyeliner, light lipstick).

I only started wearing a bit of makeup since moving away from home &amp; entering college, but still very very basic (bb cream, little foundation powder, blush, tinted lip balm, &amp; occasionally a little barely there eyeliner (I suck at it) &amp; mascara).

I don’t have any pitting from zits but I do have scaring since you can tell where I mostly got zits and used to pop and pick at the scabs when I was younger. 
I put foundation on and set with a smashbox powder and I feel like 2 hours later it’s like I never even put makeup on. You can see all the red spots clear as day. I used to think it was because I touched my face a lot but I’ve since stopped that so I’m not sure why the makeup wears away so fast.

1578605107,Makeup,Eyeliner and setting spray?,"Hi!
I’m kinda new to makeup, I started to use it for cosplay only, but recently started wearing it every day. I’m not really good at it, but that’s to be expected since I started in October, and have barely touched makeup before (have only used concealer before this). 

I need help finding an eyeliner that doesn’t smudge, and try to disappear if I accidentally touch it. I haven’t figured out how to apply liquid liner and have it look good. I’ve tried with a few cosplay looks and I’m never happy with it.
Recently I’ve been using the NYX epic black mousse liner, and really like it, but if I touch it, there is a high risk it all goes to heck. Idk if it’s the mousse or the pencil I’ve been using with it to fill in smaller gaps that I don’t dare touch with a brush. (Don’t remember what brand the pencil is, and the name has kinda faded so I can’t make it out 😬)

I just really want to know if something like that exists, and what brands. And if not, how do I deal with the things I already have.

Also, I’m wondering about setting spray. Is it worth it? What effect does it have, and if it’s recommended, what brands do you guys recommend?

I don’t have a lot of money, so if there are any cheaper brands you recommend, I would greatly appreciate it."

1578663943,Makeup,Pore reducer and/or blurring product?,"I’m in my mid 30s, with very dry skin, and I usually look a couple years older than my age. I also have large pores. A long while back I received a sample of Estée Lauder The Estee Edit Pore Vanishing Stick, but I only recently got around to actually trying it. I loved it! I felt like it made my skin look so good, and actually made me look a little younger! I got about two weeks’s sort of wear out of the sample, so it wasn’t just a one time thing. When I went to buy the full size, I found that the entire Estee Edit line no longer exists, including the pore vanishing stick. I seriously loved the way it made me look, so I wanted to find a similar product. 

I went to Ulta to get suggestions on what to try, and their two suggestions were Benefit’s the POREfessional face primer, and Elf’s pore reducing primer. The Elf primer didn’t really do anything. The Benefit primer definitely did help the appearance of my pores so that was nice, but I don’t feel like it makes me look smoother and younger, the way the pore vanishing stick did. A friend suggested just using a pore reducing face wash, which also helped the appearance of my pores, but didn’t do much else, plus my already dry skin felt even drier. 

Another friend suggested what I really want is a blurring product, but at this point I’ve already spent money on a few products that weren’t quite right, and some of these blurring products seem pretty expensive.

When I first started with makeup, I just curled my lashes normally, and then applied mascara, but the curl went out as soon as the mascara brush touched them.

I googled it, and found a girl who had the same problem. I saw a video she made where she explained how she curled her lashes and had them stay that way when she applied mascara. And I’ve been using that method since.

First, I heat the lash curler with a blow dryer, and curl the lashes. Then apply waterproof mascara, because that somehow sets the curl, and then apply another layer of some other type of mascara, of your choice. She used three different mascaras for volume, but I’m only using two.

The problem is, I don’t think this is good for my lashes. They don’t really feel different than before, but apparently you’re not supposed to wear waterproof mascara that often, and if you do, do it sparingly, but I wear it everyday.
My makeup looks way better with curled lashes, and this is the only method I’ve found, and it looks kinda good in my opinion. (Though I only just started in October). But I want to know if it’s “safe” to continue doing this, or if heating my lashes and/or wearing waterproof mascara will damage them somehow?"

Hi, all. I'm a late-twenties woman with mild to moderate acne concerns who also happens to be very pale. When I do manage to find a foundation that doesn't break me out and wears nice on my often-dry skin, it's either too dark from the get-go or oxidizes, and I can't wear it.

I don't wear much makeup at all, really. Just a little bit when I'm going to work or church. I'm looking for a natural-looking foundation/bb cream/skin tint that feels light-weight and will, in combination with a concealer if necessary, cover/blur mild acne without making it worse. It's also, again, gotta be pale without any yellow or pink undertone.

I can't wear Lancome Double Wear because it breaks me out, but my color is Cool Bone, if that helps, and it's the best color match I've ever found. In another example, Maybelline dream BB Pure in 110 ""Light/Medium Sheer Tint"" is too dark.

Can someone give me suggestions as to what I should be wearing? I'm not a guru, by any means. I'm also really into non-harmful ingredients.

So, I guess my needs are:

1. very pale
2. not make me break out
3. not bad for you
4. natural-looking

I appreciate any advice you can give me! Thanks!

1578789441,Makeup,How to know if mascara applicators/wands are vegan-friendly?,"I recently purchased Tarte's Sea Surfer Curl Volumizing Mascara (advertised as a vegan formulation) and realized after using for several day that the bristles are ""natural bristles."" Natural bristles to me means boar hair, which is not vegan-friendly. Does ""natural bristles"" always mean boar hair bristles? 

I reached out to Tarte at the beginning of the week but have not received a response. I also reached out to Stila and Too Faced about the materials used for their applicators (I also own mascara form these brands) and have also not received a reply. 

A commonality I saw amongst all of these brands was that they claimed the formulation was vegan, but they do not make a statement regarding the applicator. Why make a vegan formula and include a boar hair applicator? This literally makes no sense to me. Ultimately, if anyone knows what the new Taste mascara applicator is made of, I would greatly appreciate clarification. Also, guidance on how to be more informed on vegan mascara applicators is much appreciated!

1578854089,Makeup,I never used my most expensive makeup. Here's how I learned to use it (and love it) (long term Natasha Denona eyeshadow review),"I've had the Natasha Denona Lila, Sunset and Aeris palette for over a year, and I almost never used them ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. They always ended up looking ""wrong"" on my eyes, even though I loved the formular. Some months ago, I decided that I refuse to let 250$ worth of eyeshadow go to waste, and here's what I learned along the way.

**Go back to makeup school:** Sometimes we just apply things wrong because we're used to doing things a certain way. Changing our techniques a little can make all the difference. I used to apply matte shades in my crease first. With ND shadows, I always apply the metallic shade first, and then a matte shade if needed.

**Trust your instincts:** You're applying your new product, and it already looks cute. But YouTube tells you that you should apply 7+ shades, glitter that's not eyesafe and a cut crease. Now you look like a muddy mess. If you already like your look, put your brush down and move on.

**Make it simple:** If you find that the product is hard to use, find a way to make it easy. Try applying it quickly or messily, maybe only use one or two shades. I find that effortless products usually gets the most use

**Respect the product and experiment:** A lot of high end products tend to have unique shades and/or textures. This is awesome, but it may not work to apply the product in the same shape or the same place. A concealer may look amazing when more is applied, but if it creases like nothing you've ever seen before and stays put when only a little is applied, you've just found your new ""no makeup makeup"" concealer (looking at you Chanel Palette Essentielle).

Now I finally use my ND palettes, but it also worked with my Chanel Palette Essentielle, my Mac Pro Conceal and Correct Palette and my Dior Backstage Palette Cool Neutrals. 

I'm not saying that all high end makeup is worth it, because sometimes a product is just *bad*. I love the ND palettes I bought, the formular is very consistent and lasts the entire day. I think they're worth it, but here's a couple of reasons why they may not be for you:

1. They're too expensive. Roll credits.
2. You only wear neutral brown shades. Natasha Denona likes color. Even most of her browns will have a twist to them.
3. You are an eyeshadow savant, and you can make literal dirt look like you've just had en afternoon visit from Charlotte Tilbury.

Hope this helps you get some use out of all that expensive makeup that's hiding in your drawers. &lt;3"

1578876406,Makeup,I hope no one makes the mistake I just made-- binge shopping makeup online from ebay and Amazon.,"My new year's resolution was to start wearing more makeup than my usual mascara, eyeliner, and lipstain look.  I used to wear BareMinerals loose powder eyeshadow, blush, foundation, etc but the stuff I have is 10 years old.  So I went online and bought all new replacements on ebay and amazon-- 26 items in a few days.

Every single item I bought is either counterfeit (foundation, mineral veil, radiance, and some eyeshadows) or expired.  Seriously I was sold eyeshadow made in 2006 from Amazon.  I checked the manufacture dates on each item with BareMinerals.  They said their loose powder eyeshadow expires after 3 years on the shelf. 

I know there are many reputable sellers on ebay and Amazon and I don't want to insult honest resellers.  I wish I'd looked closer at feedback before buying.  I assumed ""top rated sellers"" were reputable.  Not necessarily. 

BareMinerals foundation and mineral veil and radiance are the most often counterfeited BareMinerals products.  The packaging doesn't look right when compared to authentic items.  I never opened any of the counterfeit products to check consistency and coverage but I read that the low quality is pretty obvious. 

BareMinerals eyeshadow is counterfeited by refilling an authentic container with a cheaper makeup with similar color.  You can see the color difference in the jar by comparing it to an authentic jar.  I never opened the jars but I read that the counterfeits are most obvious when applied they just don't have quality pigmentation. 

Every BareMinerals product has a batch code stamped on the container that indicates the date of manufacture.  I contacted BareMinerals directly to get the actual dates.

So now I have the unpleasant task of returning 26 items to a few unscrupulous ebay sellers and some amazon sellers who were not aware they were selling products that expired 3 to 10 years ago.

I am glad that I never opened any of the makeup I bought.  And more glad that I did not contaminate my brushes with potentially harmful products.

I wish I'd just gone to Sephora or Ulta and paid for peace of mind."

Here’s the problem with lipstick- everything comes out pink. Shades that look deep purple, red or even almost black, on me always look like they are berry colored. I’ve had multiple bored Sephora employees play a game of “will this be pink?” I’ve now resorted to oranges and terracotta tones when I’m not looking for an outright bold pink but I’m still curious - why is everything else pink?!?

1578950272,Makeup,Help with mascara,"Hello everyone! 

I’m looking for mascara recommendations. Here’s kinda what I’m looking for, and what I’ve tried. 

- Lancome Monsieur Big: LOVE what this does for my lashes. Big volume and length, and jet black. However, it flakes off all day and I’m sick of cleaning it off. Also, I have a hard time getting all of it off at the end of the day, leading to a raccoon appearance the next morning. I HATE the brush. 

- Estée Lauder Sumptuous Extreme: this is probably my favorite I’ve tried. I adore the brush, and again, it makes my lashes long and voluminous. However, I don’t like the price point, that it’s hard to find travel size (can never pan a full size one and can’t justify the price on this full one), and estee is not cruelty free

- various Essence ones: love that they are cruelty free, and most looked pretty good. However, they stay on like cement even with an oil based makeup remover and I don’t want to rip out my lashes trying to remove it. 

- covergirl in the orange tube and green tube: flakes and didn’t do much for my lashes anyways. I don’t think they’re cruelty free? 

- loreal voluminous original: flaked, made curled lashes droopy, and not cruelty free. 

I’ve tried others, but these have been my most recent. I don’t wear fake lashes, so it’s important to me that my mascara does what it’s supposed to, and doesn’t flake off. I prefer cruelty free, wherever possible, and have been making the switch as a I pan products. So with that being said, any recommendations? 

TLDR: Looking for cruelty free mascara, jet black, easy to remove, gives lots of length and volume. Willing to pay for high end, but definitely prefer when a travel size can be purchased for the high end stuff since I can’t pan mascara before it dries up usually."

My first thing I wanted to tackle was eyeliner but I can’t figure out what my eye shape is! I’m looking for a photo or picture that I can copy that will suit my eyes.

1578975303,Makeup,"Is using lip liner as like, lipstick, a thing? Do other people do that?","I'm not super into lip makeup unless it's lipgloss, basically because I end up wiping it off, picking it off, licking it off, or eating it off in two seconds, and lipgloss is one that's the easiest to put off and come off without making me look like a rabid dog. 

I recently bought lip liner for a lipstick I bought and it ended up being a horrible, horrible match. Just for kicks, I put the lip liner on as if it were lipstick and blended it out a little so it didn't look so dry and it didn't look half bad. I honestly really liked it, it was matte too so it didn't transfer horribly unless I really tried to make it transfer. It also didn't feel like a thick coat of liquid lipstick, which I've tried and hated. 

I think this was a thing like, Kylie Jenner did or supposedly did or something, I'm not entirely sure. This is a thing other people do though, right? I'm basically asking so I feel less bad about doing something that I can't tell if other people do because I'm extremely insecure about how bad I am at makeup.

I’ve tried mostly concealers in little pots but they sometimes turn out too dry or not enough coverage. Should I try a liquid concealer? Preferably on the cheaper side as I’d only use a few times a month when I get bad flare ups. I also don’t use foundation so a concealer that is good on its own would also be a great recommendation.

The issue is it’s a very thin brush like a nail polish brush- so i went to Ulta to purchase something different. I bought Tarte tarteist double take eyeliner, and as much as I love the application- I found that it does not like my eyes. The ends of my eyes where I like to do a little cat eye are super watery which makes it difficult for me to apply eyeliner.

1576013619,Makeup,Besame Cosmetics 1970 Chocolate Kiss - and affordable dupes?,"Anyone else pine for this color? It's a pretty, underrated color and I'm surprised more brands haven't jumped on bringing this specific sort of shade back. Most brown shades that are coming back are in that '90s vein of being straight brown, beige nude, or dusky pink. I haven't seen anything that falls perfectly in the spectrum like this does.

Chocolate Kiss is not quite terracotta. But not entirely brown or rosy. It somehow has facets of all of these, while still retaining that ""chocolate"" quality.

I'm ruminating on the idea of dupes before I go after Chocolate Kiss, but I don't think there's many drugstore-wise. Maybe higher-end brands do, but I'm not extensively familiar with their lip color ranges. Honestly if I did want to spend that extra money I'd just buy Chocolate Kiss to begin with.

My first dupe idea was the classic Toast of New York by Revlon, which would've been perfect if it didn't lean more red.

My next and last one so far was an oldie for me, Nature's Blush by L'Oreal. Beautiful shade, but I *hate* the scent and aftertaste of those Color Riche lipsticks, not unless they've changed in recent years."

The only ingredient in my Zoeva foundation I could be reacting to is the rosehip oil but that may be due to the hayfever weather at the moment according to google?

""Eventually the raw material excavated by Pooja and her peers will be collected by a broker who sells it to an exporter, who then delivers it to a manufacturer, typically in China. It’s then milled into fine, pearly pigment that is purchased by international beauty companies to add a reflective finish to eyeshadow, blush, lipstick, and more. Everyone in the supply chain financially benefits from obscuring the origin of the mica through this complicated turn of hands, because it keeps costs low by allowing exporters to exploit the people mining it."""

1576107795,Makeup,"Two questions. What is the best kind of makeup to start out with, and are magnetic eyelashes recommended?","So, I’ve recently begun to use makeup more frequently. Up until this point, I’ve gotten some passive aggressive comments from my dad and older sister about wearing a little bit, but I’ve finally put my foot down and told them to stfu. 
I’ve been experimenting with eye stuff, and I’m not sure what the best sort of eyeliner or eyeshadow to use. Heck, I don’t even know how to apply eyeshadow so that it doesn’t look over the top. Since I’m only starting out, is there any recommended brands for liquid liner and that sort of thing? I’ve also been looking into getting magnetic lashes since the glue is really messy and a pain to deal with, but I’m not sure where to start with that.
Other than the eye question, should I buy some sort of “starter kit” with everything I need? I’ve seen a few around generally (little zipper bags with a few different products) but I’m not sure if they’re actually reliable or just little toys for 12 year olds.
In order to stop myself from rambling on, I’m gonna just stop by asking if there’s any recommended blogs/YouTube channels where I can learn this on my own. The amount of beauty gurus on YouTube are pretty intimidating, but I’m sure that there are some genuinely helpful people on the platform. I have no one to ask about this stuff irl, so Reddit is sort of my only option at the moment.
Sorry if this was a bit much, but I’d appreciate some helpful tips. Thanks!"

1576116856,Makeup,Any tips for using concealer and/or foundation only around the eyes?,"Don't nuke this post from orbit just yet, I know the idea is god awful but hear me out!

I've gone my whole gosh darn life never using makeup outside of some dabs of foundation under my eyes on sleep deprived days. It works, sorta. Though now I'm wondering if that's, well.... sacrilege? Haha!

The skin below and beside my eyes have always had this tired, sunken look to them. My skin is clear - maybe the occasional blemish but nothing outstanding, so I don't feel the need to dress up my whole face. I prefer a natural look - after my whole life looking one way, suddenly looking totally different is really uncomfortable. But I'm not against some touch-ups when needed.

Anyone have any vids or articles or product suggestions for things to use under or around your eyes only? I'm no stranger to blending having an art background, and I figure a face is a canvas and colors need to blend, which I already do with what I've been doing, and I won't be stopping!

I'll never know my skin tone though. I guess I'll just go to Sephora and ask for professional help, hah! Thanks everyone!"

This year the only one I've seen do that is Like Crime with some mini lip kits and such. 
Last year, to name a few, Colourpop has the Rainbow Dreams thing (ok, now they've released all those vaults, but not really holiday-targeted), and BH has the Royal Collection, and Fenty had that iced/frosted collection. This year, nada.

1. Apply BB cream with beauty blender
2. conceal under-eyes
3. contour nose with bronzer and highlighter
4. Pink blush on cheeks
5. highlighter above cheeks and under eyebrows (i'm not sure what the point is but I heard it looks better?)
6. Pencil eyeliner on top waterline and very lightly on the outer corners of the lower waterline
7. Mascara

I'm sooo sick of people asking me what's wrong when there is nothing wrong whatsoever. if I could raise the ends of my eyebrows just half an inch upward, my problems would be solved. Is there any way to fix this without having to get an expensive eyebrow lift? are there any techniques I could do with makeup that could give me the illusion of higher brows?.

 I was told concealer is A+ for things like this and will always leave my lips looking perfect.

1576194979,Makeup,Questions about highlighter and eyeliner.,"1. So I have a monolid on one side and a hooded lid on the other. Sometimes, they're both monolids. Whenever I'm doing my eyeliner, I usually do just a wing with no liner at the lash line because it's too troublesome, and I don't want it to look too strong. However, when I have to do the whole way or feel like it, it looks weird. When my lids are different, the monolid side has too be thicker than the hooded one. My main concern is that whenever I close my eyes or blink, others will see the difference in thickness, even for a fraction of a second. Part of me thinks no one really cares about how thick my eyeliner is just as long as it looks even when my eyes are open, right? Anyone have any tips on how to even the eyeliner without looking too wonky?

2. Another thing is highlighter. I have been thinking of getting highlighter recently for my everyday look. A question I have is why there's different colors. A palette I'm interested in has light pink, cream-ish, and brown-ish. Why are there different colors of highlighter? Isn't it just white, or something light?

I've been looking for a shade like this to give to her as a gift for years now, but for whatever reason it's really hard to find a lip gloss shade like this. Right now I'm eyeing the NYX Shimmer Down Lip Veil in Pout and About, but I know this formula to be more sheer, it's extremely glittery, something she might like but not prefer for every day, and the color isn't really a true red. I'm also looking at the Buxom gloss in Natalie, another very close color, but the glitter isn't gold. Tonya has the gold glitter, but the gloss itself is more pink than red.

I'm now turning to the internet for help. What's the best true red lip gloss with gold glitter you've tried? I can't find anything on Sephora's website that matches my exact description. I am willing to spend up to about $35 for this and I'm willing to order from out of my country, USA. All of the products I buy (makeup and otherwise) are not tested on animals, but for this one gift I am willing to look the other way because it's very special to my mom.

Anyways, my foundation is always off either it’s too dark or too light. I want to have even toned skin when I glam up, which required slathering my chest with foundation and setting powder. I see people on Instagram who apply foundation and it matches them SO FREAKING WELL. They don’t even need to blend to their neck. If someone has similar issues as me, how do you pick your foundation?

I used Urban Decay for a while but it never helped that much and then I found out one of the ingredients is really bad for oily skin and it's part of what would make my foundation separate. I'm tired of spending money on expensive foundations when they'll only work as well as the primer I put them over. Would love some suggestions from people with similar issues. I've also tried most drug store brands and they suck. I'm looking for better quality stuff.

I just really want to give her something special, hence me making this post. I was thinking of getting her some kind of palette. I was thinking maybe a newer one because I don’t want to risk getting her one she already owns. I know she likes neutrals and pinks, so something along those lines. I want it to be good quality, but not super expensive. I would also prefer it to be something that isn’t out of stock and is found in most stores since I have to by it soon.

1576356590,Makeup,"I like makeup, but I have no idea where to start.","I'm a relatively feminine guy (never felt pressured to 'perform masculinity'), and I've done just enough theater to have had makeup put on me a number of times. I quite liked it. I'd like to learn how to use makeup more, but I have no idea where to start. Most of the resources I've found are either directed at women and assume a baseline knowledge of makeup that I lack, or are directed at men and focus specifically on using makeup 'secretly' and without looking feminine, which isn't something I'm really worried about. 

If anyone has tips/resources/advice on where to start and what kinds of things to buy, I'd very much appreciate it. In particular, I'd like to learn how to use eyeliner (and maybe mascara, if there's a way to do so without it being a pain in the ass), but any and all information is welcome. I have three main criteria:

1. I know makeup is expensive, and you get what you pay for to some extent, but I don't want to spend a lot of money. 
2. I don't want to have to constantly maintain it, if possible. I don't know the extent to which ""fire and forget"" makeup exists, but that's what I'm looking for.
3. I don't really want to cover my entire face. Foundation is, in my experience, somewhat uncomfortable, and I don't really feel compelled to cover all of my skin.

1576366006,Makeup,Lipstick colors for a 13 y/o,"Hi guys!!! Doing some Christmas shopping, a bit last minute, but my sister asked me for lipstick. While I'm well versed in lipstick types and such, I'm didn't start wearing makeup/lipstick until I was like 17/18, due to that ""not like other girls"" phase. Fortunately, my sister has had better influences than I did as far as that, so she's actually eager to do makeup and lipstick. 

I'll probably get her some glosses and such for more causal looks, but sometimes we do have things where we have to dress up a bit, which may call for some lipstick. I don't want to go at it and give her the dark bold colors I go for, since I don't think they'd be super appropriate nor would my parents appreciate that. 

So if anyone has suggestions or ideas, I'd love that!! I'm thinking like a nice dusty rose or colors like that? But I don't know which all would be tastes a 13 year old would have, since she isn't fond of my particular aesthetic or preferences."
1576369115,Makeup,Pinky Beige muted lipstick,"Having a hard time finding a shade that I like and I've tried so many. 

I'm basically trying to find a dupe of the Gerard Cosmetics Hydra Matte in the shade Skinny Dip. Unfortunately the formula makes me break out around my mouth and it's my most loveliest favorite shade and I just can't find anything to match it. 

I'm aware there's some dupes but I've gone off of matte lipsticks, so I'm looking for a creamy satin...basically any kind of formula as long as it's not matte. 

Highend, drug store, does anybody have any recommendations? 

I self tan and I'm usually around nc30-40. I find that alot of lipsticks pull a little brown on me and prefer the lip to look more pinky. I'm not a fan of rose coloured bright colours, just a muted beige lightish pink that runs more cool but not purple grey.

In regards to the skinny dip hunt I've tried nearly all of the too faced natural nudes, dose of colors stone, too faced melted matte child star, mufe rosewood, dose of colors blush. And probably more.

I've been looking at Tom Ford pink dusk but I'm on the fence as its super expensive. It doesn't look like skinny dip but I'm wondering if it'd be a flattering shade for me. Does anyone have it?

I also just got Huda bombshell after taking a risk (not as a match to skinny dip but trying a new colour) and the swatches make it look like a flattering colour for tan skin but on me it runs wayyyy too orange for my liking. I'm open to recommendations for flattering colours for tan skin too. I have greeny blue grey eyes and dark brown hair.

1576390547,Makeup,clear lip liner application,"OK, so in my mind clear lip liner (i.e. urban decay 24/7 lip liner in Ozone) should be applied around the outer edge of the lips in effort to keep lipstick from feathering, smudging, etc. the problem is, I don't know how to do this without disturbing my foundation. I tried applying the clear liner on the inner edge of my lips  (thus making no contact with the skin on my face at all), but then my lip products don't apply very well over the top of it. the color doesn't adhere to my lips when it comes in contact with the clear liner. thus, I feel like the point of a clear liner is to go AROUND the lips, barely touching the edge. but, when I do this, it messes up my foundation around my lips and rubs it off. I feel like I'm not explaining this very well, but I hope someone knows what I mean. lol. here's a link to an image that illustrates my point: [ http://myhighestselfblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4-ways-to-use-clear-lipliner-Barrier.png](http://myhighestselfblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4-ways-to-use-clear-lipliner-Barrier.png)"

For Christmas I thought it would be nice to have a whole ""Kit"". Unfortunately, it's very overwhelming as someone who doesn't know anything about makeup.

Do you have any recommendations? I am in the UK and my wife has grey/green eyes, fair skin and dark blond hair.

1576441640,Makeup,foundation keeps separating!!,"I have this huge problem with foundation. It keeps separating on my forehead mostly between my brows and in the very center. I’ve tried various foundations of different formulas like water and silicone based.

So I’m going to list off what I think I’m doing right.

- I have a 10 step korean skincare routine (I exfoliate a reasonable amount of times per week) 
- I primer before foundation 
- I let my skincare absorb for 30-60min before makeup 
- I don’t use silicone based primers as much and if I do I make sure not to mix with water based foundation.

When I first apply foundation it’s separates and looks patchy right away. I use a sponge and sometimes a brush and does the same with both. Then after a couple of hours my forehead looks soooo bad. It’s even more patchy and looks like the foundation sunk into my pores.

I have oily skin but I’ve used foundations with a natural and matte finish. Even though I’m oily I still moisturize my face. I really only have an oily forehead and my nose too, but the rest of my face isn’t too bad, like I don’t have to blot or touch up my cheek and jaw area as much. 

Products that’s I’ve used in the past and didn’t work for me or that I still use but kind of work for me: 
-Makeup forever HD foundation (works okay)
-Becca matte primer 
-milk hydro primer (love, but still doesn’t work for forehead)
- it cosmetics cc cream (hate)
-colourpop no filter concealer (looks bad on forehead)
-Too faced peach perfect foundation (terrible)
- Dermablend foundation 
-elf poreless putty primer 
- wet n wild photofocus foundation 
- rimmel stay matte primer 
- Laura mercier translucent powder (actually love it)
-cover fx translucent powder (looks terrible on my forehead!!) 

I’ve mixed and matched all of this products before and nothing seems to help. Please tell me what I’m doing wrong or lmk if you have this problem too!!"

Without makeup, my skin looks so smooth, but with makeup it looks crepey and cakey.  The only combo I like right now is Glossier stretch concealer which I set with Glossier Wowder setting powder- the creasing is minimal and it looks pretty natural, but unfortunately it's not full coverage. (if you look at my post history, my last post is a pic of me wearing this.) I just want something that can cover my genetic dark circles that doesn't make the texture of my skin look worse. My skin isn't super dry but I always make sure to moisturize before putting on makeup.  In the picture I posted here, I'm wearing Mac face and body with NARS creamy concealer. (the bottom left is a picture of me smiling- I was so horrified when I saw this pic. The top one is a pic of me without makeup so you can see the difference.) I've also had issues with concealer creasing a lot even when I use powder. I'm not sure if I need a new foundation, concealer, or powder, or if my moisturizer isn't good enough, but I would really appreciate some advice. I want to feel confident wearing a full face of makeup instead of feeling self conscious about how my eyes look especially when I'm smiling. Right now I just stick to casual ""every day"" makeup because when I try to wear more of a full face with full coverage products I run into this problem. I'm not really that knowledgeable about makeup so I apologize if this is a dumb post but I'm just really frustrated and I don't know how to fix this.

I’m actually looking into writing the company to see if it will get me anywhere. But now I’m on the market for a new liquid eyeliner. I prefer a felt tip pen.

1576564427,Makeup,Some advice on foundation.,"The only makeup I use is foundation because my skin is not very healthy at this point. I’ve tried three foundations and finally found the one I like (Bobbi Brown makeup stick). The only problem is that while it has amazing coverage and a really natural finish (bonus is that it matches my skin tone really well), it tends to get oily by the end of the day. I’ve tried to put on powder and it works but I don’t want to do that additional step everyday. I have used a water based foundation which matched my skin tone too, but it is not available where I live. I also like to rest my face on my hands and I haven’t been able to do that ever since. Any tips for this? Sorry if this is a very basic question, I’m basically a makeup noob"

I tried to get that tonight but that palette as well as all the other palettes I like on that site are sold out. 

She has a lot of makeup so I don't want to buy her something she already has, unfortunately I don't know what she has atm. I do remember her saying that the Pat Mcgrath starwars palette would be the most expensive one that she owns if she got it so to be safe can you guys recommend something that is more than $65 but under $90?  She really likes eye shadows but if there's something else that you think would be a good christmas gift I'm open to suggestions. Thanks!"

1576623339,Makeup,Ways to Decrease Eyeshadow Fallout/Eyeshadow Smudge?,"Hi all! I have been practicing and refining my eyeshadow technique for years now, but I still have a long way to go. I was never taught by a parent or sibling how to do makeup, so I really only got deep into it a few years back, after gaining a bestie who happened to be a MUA. I haven't even touched eyeliner, brows, foundation, or concealer yet, so I'm taking baby steps!

However, I do have a large number of beauty products, and I find myself quite overwhelmed with how to maximize their use. To begin with, I have a lot of makeup brushes, but I don't know which ones are best for your eyes, or which ones that are specific to eyes are best for certain parts of your eye (crease vs. lid vs. corner, etc.). In addition, I have always had trouble blending, and I often suffer from a LOT of shadow fallout. I then have to use makeup remover to get rid of it, since simply using a full-face brush just cakes the color onto my under-eye or cheeks.

I've seen the heaviest amount of fallout from highly-pigmented palettes, such as **Violet Voss Coral Crush** and **The Warrior by Juvia's**. So, my main questions are:

1. Am I experiencing heavy fallout because I'm using brushes incorrectly?
2. When using a blending brush, am I supposed to use the color I want to blend on this brush, or am I supposed to use the brush naked to blend the colors I already have?
3. What are the best brush types to use for the different parts of your eye?

Thanks for reading!"

My skin type used to be oily, but now it's mainly my forehead that's oily, and my cheeks are mixed between oily and dry. I don't know how to even describe or explain it, but it's not just oily or just dry, it's both. 

I should also mention I'm not the biggest fan of wearing a face full of make up. Like, I would much rather wear something just on the places I'm trying to hide, like a concealer, but like I said, I'm struggling to find one that works. Most tend to cling to the acne and cake up, regardless of how I try to manipulate it, or are too yellow, even if it's considered the right shade for me. So it might cover the red spot, but now it's a yellow splotch on my face because I'm pale and pink. 

If anyone has any suggestions that are on the drugstore price end, I'd be super grateful. I'm getting married soon and the last time I didn't bring my own make up, the relative that did it used her stuff that was too tan and I was orange. I'm not making that mistake again. 

Also, any drugstore brushes or anything for concealer or foundation that aren't too bad, I'd love to hear about. I probably need to buy some brush or sponge with it as well. 

Thanks in advance."

* Are large bulbs better, like this?

* I see lots of people using ring lights, are they just for filming? 
* If you could only have a ring light with a mirror in the middle, or a big mirror with big bulbs which would you choose?
* What temperature light am I looking for? Cool or warm etc?
* If you were designing your dream makeup table, what features/options would you really value, or what would really annoy you?

1573403125,Makeup,"For those who are just starting makeup and buy high end products right away, why?","I’ve been doing makeup for 3 years now, for the first 1 1/2 - 2 years I used strictly drugstore. I knew this would be smarter in the long run considering I was a beginner and I felt like I didn’t deserve a high end palette. 

I’ve had this question in my mind for awhile because with the release of the J* x Shane Dawson collab, I’ve seen a lot of my peers and people online fall into two categories with it 1. they buy it just because it’s a Shane Dawson product 2. they want to start doing makeup. (If you bought the palette and won’t use it, why bother?) 

I feel like if you’re starting to get into makeup, go drugstore for about two years and then once you finally get good, start incorporating higher end stuff into your makeup routine. Do not buy a high end product if you are just starting off doing makeup, you will not be able to use the palette/product to its fullest extent. If you think just because it’s high end, it’ll look better, chances are... it won’t. Just because it’s high end, does NOT mean it’ll look good right away. I never understood why people don’t go to the drugstore first, so this is why I asked my question. 

Also, people who go buy high end makeup before they learn the way around the drugstore and you know... look good, is by far my biggest pet peeve as a makeup artist."

1573418311,Makeup,Please help!! mainly for recommendations on MAC vs higher end products. Planning doing a haul tomorrow.,"Hey everyone, so just to give you a summary: I am ready after a year in hospital, feeling and looking like shit, to make a BIG investment in some true ""holy grail"" products which is why I need to get it bang on correct. I have so much money on high end products that will never ever get used because they are completely the wrong colour or just don't look good.I've been taking my time seeking advice from department stores (which has caused me nothing but SEVERE frustration - ie i have been given 4 different shades of mac studio fix FROM 4 DIFFERENT ""MAC shops) - without my skintone changing at all. It seems everybody tells you something different and all it has done has caused me more and more frustration, I basically do not have a clue what suits me, what my skintone is, what colours will go with my eyes and hair etc - that I just stick to nudes basically. I really like this place and you guys always have really good advice, so I think that at least some people will be able to completely relate to me here and give me the best advice. In advance, I am sorry for writing so much. I have a MAC sale here - everything!!! 30% off. This is something I need thought I'd see in my life and probably never will again. It ends tomorrow and I'm looking for advice mainly on MAC vs higher end stuff that I've been used to always using in the past (Dior, Chanel.. ). Is there really  a difference in products and the lasting power of them?? I am willing to really invest here.

I never wear anything on my face. I don't like the feel or even the idea of layers and layers of stuff on top of my skin. I have my skincare am/pm routine and don't really like to put anything on top of my day moisturiser (clinique smart day SPF and smart serum.) What I tend to do is just dab lightly some estee lauder double wear on any red marks or spots (I also have the NARS creamy concealer which is great) and then sometimes a bit of smashbox pore minimizing primer on my nose and inner cheek area which I like how it looks.So I never cover my face but have been wanting to get into it all for a healthier look - without anything heavy (which is why i can only dab the double wear on marks. i find it much to heavy for a full face). I don't know where to begin. I've tried samples for 3 weeks now of MAC, dior, Bobbi Brown and EL.Regarding my skintone - it's light now, my extremely tiny, hidden veins are blue, i definitely have pinkish undertone as opposed to yellow and silver jewelley looks better. So, definitely a cool? So I have no idea why the lady at a MAC counter and then a visit to a MAC store told me that I need an NW shade. I am so confused. It was definitely too yellow on me.2 others told me NC10 which makes me look like a freaking zombie and completely washed out,Then on Friday, the most helpful lady yet told me nc15 and actually gave a sample - all the rest were so rude and wouldn't  give me a tiny sample to see how it looked in daylight, lasted on my skin, if it oxidises etc. Also I wasted a fortune on studio fix liquid and powder over a year ago, sold by a clueles guy, in shade NW35!!!! never had makeup so yellow ever. It went in the bin.

I desperately have been searching for my perfect lipliner and lipstick and had my eyes fixed on Charlotte Tilbury pillow talk. I tested it twice and the first time liked it and second time completely washed me out and made me look weird also. I am looking for a perfect pinkish nude. That exactly matches my natural colour. I am used to using only the Dior Addict lip glow and gloss (not the coloured ones). Nothing with any of these muddy browns or anything. Totally washes me out.So what I went I bought: mac matte lipstick in Velvet Teddy and the MAC liner in boldly bear. I still don't really know how they'd look on me, been too ill over the weekend to test a face out. Would you guys recommend these or advise on other colours with regards to what I'm looking for? Is there really much of a difference in paying crazy money for  CT pillow  talk? ie: does it last much longer, is it more pigmented and ""better quality""? etc.. I was sold the same MAC liner in the shade Half Red the last time I went and asked for a pinkish nude. I HATE IT! It is absolutely not what I was asking for in any way shape or form. I feel like it doesn't last 5 minutes. I don't rub my lips together or lick them, they are not oily etc etc .. and it  just doesn't last. Does anyone have opinions or tips on this? Making it last longer etc. All of the reviews I read there's so many people saying it lasts super long.

I planned on going back tomorrow as this MAC sale ends but don't want to be buying anything that I'll hate.

Mascara is my number one go to item. I never stray away from my HG mascara which is the diorshow iconic, and kevyn aucoin curlers.I stick to more nudish eyeshadow. I bought the new MAC art library palette in ""nude model""and will definitely get use out of this. I can honestly say it is a million times better than the UD naked 2 and reloaded which i tested the other day. I found them to have barely any pigmentation, so frustrating to try to blend, and way too much fallout. This MAC one seems like a dream compared to their small palettes of 9 - i bought the amber x 9.. again .. the pigmentation awful, blending a bit hard. These new ones the formula is totally different and feels very high end.

Again, would you recommend anything ""higher end"" ?

And finally, (!! i'm so sorry that this got so long) i  want to invest in real amazing, quality brushes. I've only ever bought MAC brushes and a couple Bobbi Brown. Look after them good and I find they will last forever. Your guys recommendations./thoughts regarding brushes?Do you have specific mac brush recommendations? I can check if i alreay have it. Or is there stuff out there of better quality.. that maybe comes in a set so I don't have to buy loads of seperate brushes? (this is the thing I am most willing to invest in, i need real good quality. Thoughts on the mac? )

And blush - she (lady at mac) told me to go back tomorrow and suggested couple dupes for a blusher of NARS orgasm. I think the nars one is incredible, never used one from mac. Can anyone advise in comparing them and if it's worth buying mac blush instead of the NARS one?

So i guess really, needing all the advice, and your thoughts on the quality and lasting power on mac products vs Dior, Chanel. Bobbi Brown etc?And my huge foundation dilemma with a good blush/contour? My aim is a natural look with as little product on my face (tricky because of cystic acne scarring and still getting it on my chin).

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read my massive rant and can offer advice !!"

1573443411,Makeup,Best high end primers for oily leaning combo skin?,"Hi! I'm still a bit of a beginner to makeup and primers always confused the bejeezus out of me. I am not really a fan of Smashbox primers even though I see them everywhere. Had two, both separated my makeup and it just made the foundation slip off everywhere after a while of using it, egh. Yes, I tried the green one and the clear silicone one. I also had the Farsali Rose Gold Elixir which made my foundation actually look really amazing and was great on my lips, best I tried, super flawless and blended amazing with my liquid foundation. Problem: I'm allergic to oranges and it has a bit of it in there! So I had a tiny reaction to it! Who knew. Liquid kind of primers helps a lot with my liquid foundation, usually Maybelline Fit Me Matte and Poreless because it matches my shade (damn you Sephora for not being extremely pale friendly lol!) I heard a dupe for it is the Nyx Dew Me Up primer? Also is Farsali Skintune good as a uh, replacement or stand in for the Rose Gold Elixir? 

For context: I have sensitive acne prone skin, with an oily t-zone (yes, as well as my chin and nose) with pretty noticeable pores. my cheeks can either be oily or very dry or ""needing of hydration"" depending on the day and the winter/fall climate doesn't help really, mostly on the outer frame of my face (temples downward to the outer sides and small dry patches) is where it's mostly dry. I'm rather fair skinned with pink undertone if uh, that means anything. Heard every hype in the book about the Tatcha Silk Canvas Primer but I don't know whether to get the full size or ""travel"" size? dunno how long travel size lasts. but did try out the Fenty Beauty Pro Fil'tr Hydrating Primer, the travel size one, on my hand and it felt really hydrating and nice. Also heard about the dupe with Elf Poreless Putty Primer but literally cannot find it anywhere in person in stores, wasn't a lack of trying :( Whenever I look up ""oily skin primers"" yt videos they usually suggest the Milk Hydro Grip Primer. Is it really tacky? I even kept seeing the YSL Touche Eclat Pore Blurring primer. I don't mind a dewy or matte look if that helps anything, as long as it doesn't make my skin too... suffocate-feely. You know? Like the dry tarte shape tape, god my under eyes hated me for that one. Any suggestions help, high end or otherwise, though I have a preference for Sephora since I go there more often since it's closer to me. If it helps, my usual moisturizer that I put under my primer or foundation is the DE Polypeptide Moisturizer. Thanks! Would love any suggestions since it's a been a battle of the primers for so long for me! :)"

1573501360,Makeup,Cool toned eyeshadow for a beginner. Does buying an entire palette make sense?,"Hey guys, so I am slowly working on my makeup game. My mom and siblings have zero interest in makeup, and I honestly don't really have friends (embarassing, ik) so I don't have anyone to chat about this kind of stuff with, or to teach me. So I've been relying on reddit and Youtube for help, lol.


I feel comfortable with mascara, foundation, brows, and lip products, but I am still trying to figure out eyeliner and eyeshadow. 


Should I just focus on getting competent with one product first, and then move on to the other? 


When it comes to eyeshadow, I bought Colourpop's Sweet Talk palette on a whim. It pulls extremely orange on my fair skin because at the time I had no idea what undertones were. 


So now I feel like I'm at a dilemma. I could buy an actual neutral color packed, cool toned palette from the drugstore to get comfortable with it before dropping money on a higher end brand. 


Or, should I just buy a quad or trio to sort of get started and provide me with a no brainer eyeshadow look?"
1573502182,Makeup,"I don't understand bronzer, help?","I understand the basics. Highlight is a light, luminous product meant to go where the light hits for a glow and makes the area stand out. Contour is a dark, cool toned product that goes in the shadows, or where you would want the shadows to be, making the area look smaller.

So, a bronzer is shimmery like a highlighter, but dark like a contour product? But it goes where the light hits, as in where you would naturally tan for a sunkissed glow. We just went over how you would want to highlight those areas, not make them darker? Wouldn’t that do the opposite of what you’re going for with contouring, making your face look flatter and rounder?

Should you choose one? Can you wear both? Can you use bronzer and highlight in the same place? Do they all go in slightly different places? People use bronzer and contour products interchangeably, and place them either where contour goes, or where highlighter goes. You can't bronze and highlight your cheekbones at the same time, right? I've never seen anyone apply bronzer and contour at the same time. I'm so fucking confused."

1573543675,Makeup,Does anyone else's foundation do this?,"I'm having some problems with Zoeva's Authentik skin foundation and I was wondering if anyone else has had similar stuff going on with this foundation or some other foundation. 

I bought the shade 030N (Ambition) a while ago and absolutely fell in love with the formula. I have oily skin, huge pores on my T-zone and a really rough skin texture (stress and anxiety cause me to pick my skin quite often) and I feel like the Authentik skin is the only foundation I've tried so far that successfully covers these features instead of emphasizing them. 

Even though I loved the formula, I felt like the undertone in the shade I chose was wrong, so I bought a lighter shade, 020C (I find it rather ironic that the name of the shade is ""Amazing""). I tried the new shade a couple of days ago and it felt like I was using a totally different foundation. My face felt very dry and my pores were so visible that I felt like I should have walked around with a trypophobia warning sign. The first shade I tried had such a luminous finish and it was so lightweight but the second shade was so freaking matte and felt really heavy.

I had used a different moisturizer than I usually do the first time I tried the lighter shade so I decided to give it a second chance with my go-to moisturizer, but the same thing happened. I even tried a different powder and a different setting spray (I was hoping that would make the situation on my face a little less dry). 

This makes me really sad because I thought I had finally found the perfect foundation for me (the 030N had a great formula but it's a little too orange for me). Has anyone else had the same problem? Any idea what might be causing this?



TL;DR: Zoeva's Authentik skin foundation has a luminous finish and a great formula in the shade 030N but the shade 020C is very matte and heavy. Why is that? Does this happen with other foundations?"

1573675420,Makeup,Organic makeup is a life saver and here's why!,"Organic skin care. Ah, a life saver! Why you may ask?
It protects you from exposure to harmful chemicals, adds natural nutrients to your skin- speeds up regeneration, leading to improving elasticity/texture and most importantly keeping it hydrated without clogging pores. There are many good, rejuvenating, long lasting, highly pigmented, as-good-as-professional cosmetics brands such as 100% Pure, which is fully organic and non-toxic. I have featured a full skin care routine using this brand with other high quality, only organic products, for the perfect makeup look in the video linked below, featuring natural, totally organic brightening/blemish-removal serums. Link for video:
https://youtu.be/OflsYviOq98 #definitelynotclickbait 😏
100% Pure even has a Retinol night cream in an organic, non irritating skin balm product!
However, the cons of organic products are, lack of dermatologically active ingredients such as
1) glycolic acid,
2) salicyclic acid,
3) benzyl peroxide
in a stable form of controlled concentration. These are used to 1) unclog comedones, regenerate skin faster, 2) remove dead skin cells, 3) kill bacteria.(numbers correspond to the ingredient listed.) I could only find this in natural but non-organic products. These are active and thus best used on its own, one after the other. It may cause skin darkening if you are exposed to UV light. I prefer using it as a wash or toner that I remove to minimize the initial purging effects. Please watch the video I made and comment your opinions/your experiences with organic cosmetics! Let me know if the look was up to your expectations, as I made this video to convert you all to the organic cosmetics world I so love and I sure hope it works! Thanks for reading loves! ;)

1573776738,Makeup,Help! I'm having such a hard time figuring out my skin undertone!,"Hi everyone,

I hope this question is okay to ask here. I was wondering if I could get some help figuring out whether I'm cool, warm, or neutral because I can't seem to get a foundation that looks right.

I'm caucasian, and I know from my genealogy DNA test that my background is German, British, Scottish, Irish, Swedish, French. I don't know if that even helps or not, but I'm pretty pale.

A lot of things I've read say that brown eyed, brown haired people are warm. These are my features, but I also think I might actually be cool. I personally believe silver looks better on me, and I think my veins are more blueish-purple than green, but I kind of struggle with that one.

I have a hard time figuring out my face because I have acne pigmentation scars that left red blotches on my face so I try to look at my neck and arms. I think I tan somewhat well to a brown shade, but I also can burn pretty easily too.

My eyes look dark brown unless you see them very up close, which they then look more hazel because I have a green ring around the brown. My hair is a medium brown, but I can't figure out if my natural color looks cool or warm to me. Sometimes in certain sunlight I see red tints, but sometimes it seems more like a dull ashy color. In dim light it looks like a rich dark brown. I personally think my hair looks best when I've dyed it a dark, almost but not quite black, shade of brown because it seems to make my face and eyes pop out.

Another thing is that I never thought someone with my hair and eyes could pull off blue for some reason, but then I finally got a royal blue shirt and have gotten a lots of compliments on it looking good on me, so that also makes me think maybe I'm cool toned.

The current foundation I'm using right now is Neutrogena pressed powder in number 20, but it just doesn't look right on me. When I layer bubblegum bright pink blush on top I think it helps it look more normal on me, so maybe that is an indication that I'm cool toned also? I want to use eyeshadows, but the colors never seem to look right. Maybe that's because even if I use cool shaded eyeshadows they are clashing with my foundation?

I know this is a bunch of random facts, but can anyone make out whether they believe I'm cool or warm or neutral? Sorry for the long post! TIA!!!!"

1573870847,Makeup,How do I apply more than one eyeshadow colour using the same brush?,"Hi guys, recently I've been getting more interested in makeup whilst trying to purchase the basic products I need. 

As I've tried to become more familiar with eyeshadow and its application, my friend gifted me a Real Techniques eyeshadow brush set, which included a medium shadow brush, an essential crease brush, a shading brush, and a fine liner brush. Since then, I have tried testing these brushes out with eyeshadows, however, it seems as though after dipping and applying one colour, if I try applying a different colour, the shade is obviously muddied by the previous one. 

Does this mean I can only use one brush per shadow, and that I have to wet and clean them every time I want to use another shade? I know this sounds like a really stupid question, but every beauty guru I've seen always has like 15 different brushes per eye look!

Any help would be greatly appreciated :)"

1573888287,Makeup,Foundation Recommendation?,"Hi, I was wondering if you all could suggest a good foundation for me. Here are some qualifications:

1) has to work well with sunscreen! I use the zinc oxide kind so it's pretty thick

2) needs to be transfer-proof

3) preferably in the drugstore price range

4) skin type is a bit dry and sometimes makeup accentuates dry patches

5) needs to have a quick application - I was thinking a pressed powder would be easiest but cream/liquid/etc would be ok as well

I have a primer that's a sunscreen and feels like a dupe for Benefit Porefessional but if there's a different primer for a specific foundation then feel free to recommend that too! I'm not sure if anyone watches taylorwynn on youtube but she paired the jcat powder foundation with a catrice spray primer and it looked absolutely gorgeous on her skin! I'm not sure if that would be a good fit for me/if it's transfer-proof though. Let me know your recommendations!

Thank you!!!! 

P.S. it has to have a pretty light shade, like MAC NC15ish for reference"

1573906116,Makeup,"Estee Lauder Double Wear - didn't like, don't recommend. 3/10","So, here's why: 
I have pretty bad acne on my cheeks and chin, and I was looking for full coverage foundation. I was adviced with Estee Lauder DW and decided to try it. It looked not bad in the shop, I picked the closest to my dead-pale skin tone - 1C0. I was choosing it with a consultant, and she put it on my skin with a brush, without primer or consealer, so it didn't cover my acne completely, but I knew that I would use primer and green corrector underneath, and use sponge instead of a brush. So I bought it. And I really regret it after using it at home with a natural light. 
a) besides acne my skin is actually in a pretty good condition: a bit too oily on the nose, but great everywhere else, has that 'natural youthfull glow'. DW made it look greasy everywhere, and cakey at the same time. 
b) I am VERY pale, with a cold undertone. I bought, i think, the lightest and coldest tone, and it looked good in artificial light... but sickly yellowish in natural light. 
c) it feels like a layer of glue on my face 
d) I used primer, green corrector, consealer and two layers of foundation and it didn't cover my acne. I'm not talking about texture here, just the color. 
e) I'm talking about texture here - I don't have huge pores even on my nose, but DW made it look like I have them. 
f) even that tiny bit of contouring I use just to make my face a bit more 3d was blending dirty and patchy 
I am really disappointed. I'll stick with NYX Can't stop won't stop foundation for now. Gives same amount of coverage, but matches my tone really good and isn't greasy and sticky. Cakey, yes, but I'm starting to think that any full-coverage foundation would be like that. Also it is a lot cheaper. 
I also wanted to attach photos of my skin with no makeup, with DW and with CSWS to compare, but imgur requires a phone number and I don't want to give it."
1573913081,Makeup,Lashify- how does everyone like it? Used mine for the first time yesterday morning.,I used my lash kit for the first time yesterday morning. I struggled alittle my first time getting the lashes on but once I did they looked great. Later in the day at about 5 pm I noticed one was kind of falling off so I took it off and applied bond and then the lash again. I made sure to fuse a bunch throughout the day. When I woke up this morning one eye looked good and the other was destroyed (the lashes were flat on my eyelid). I was wondering if it was how I slept or the face that maybe I used too much bond at 5 causing my lashes to be more sticky. Also when I woke up both eye lids were kind of puffy. I love the way they look I just was hoping both eyes would last the night. Also I used to get real lash extensions but I had an allergy. What’s making me nervous now is after a nights sleep (and fixing the one eye) I have cold symptoms similar to my allergic reaction to actual lash extensions. I can’t win damnit!!

For the past two weeks I’ve been trying to make an appointment to get them taken off because they look awful now. Some of them have fallen out but most of them are pointing totally in the wrong direction, stabbing me in the eye, and some of them appear to have been glued to my eyelid and not my lashes at all.

Every time I try to call the salon to say that I want them taken off, they keep telling me the girl that does eyelashes is on vacation. This has been happening for two weeks. 

Could I possibly have someone else at a different salon take these off even though they didn’t put them on? I’m worried that most would say no because they won’t work over someone else’s work. But I don’t know what else to do because this salon is clearly not giving me an appointment anytime soon."

I put on mascara after my base + BB cream + concealer. *Make sure to take a brush or sponge and really meticulously powder the lid area esp around the lashes.*

1) Curl lashes really well (I use Tweezerman for almond shape eyes)
2) Apply coat of Etude Dr Fixer on lashes (make sure not to get it on any part of your lid bc it’ll dry on your skin) 
3) Let it dry for a couple of seconds
3) Apply coat of mascara (I use Glossier slick lash)
4) Repeat for lower lashes (personal preference) 
5) Apply coat of waterproof mascara (if going out or humid etc again personal preference- I use Maybelline Lash Senstional)

Mist face and voila!

You will have curled lashes ALL DAY LONG with ZERO smudging. Just make sure you have good miscellar water for waterproof makeup when taking it off!"

I'm 31F and have been wearing makeup since about 14. My budget does not allow for high end products so maybe that's the problem but I just don't LOVE anything I use. I've tried A LOT of foundations over the years, mid-range and drugstore.  I have fair skin, some adult acne, combo/dry (oily sometimes in the Tzone but flakey spots elsewhere!) and I have a lot of contact allergies that make things harder! I can't stand certain fragrances, drying alcohols or chamomile in products. 

I have tried: 

L'oreal true match original--- It looked too dry on my skin. The lumi version and the proglow contain denatured alcohol so they're a no go.

Milani Conceal + Perfect was way too heavy/cakey for me as well as the lightest shade at the time being too dark.

Revlon Color Stay (for combo/dry) seemed to sit on top of my skin and just didn't look right. The color washed me out and my DH actually asked if I was feeling ok and said it made me look tired/older! 

Covergirl clean sensitive version used to be my favorite in high school but as I age, it settles into fine lines. 

Wet &amp; Wild photofocus looked dry. 

Physicians formula healthy foundation has too much fragrance, as does Revlon Photoready Candid. 

I recently got samples of a few things from Sephora.... despite me asking for fragrance free, she gave me IT cosmetics CC cream and Fenty Hydrating foundation. Both have a smell and the It CC in ""fair"" was about 1-2 shades too dark! 

I am currently going back and forth between Clinique Even Better and Maybelline Fit Me dewy. These are the best I have found so far. They don't irritate my skin, don't accentuate flakes or settle into any lines and the color matches are pretty good. Problem is, neither last very long on my skin...

I'm about out of ideas and feel maybe these are the best I can get...  Are there any products I am overlooking?"

As I have dry skin I need a water-based foundation to stop cakiness and flakiness, but I really like the Maybelline eraser eye concealer. Is there any way I can make the two work without separation?  and If there isn't a solution can anyone recommend affordable water-based concealers?

1570780656,Makeup,Can't find a single foundation that works for my skin,"So, I've been wearing makeup for years, but can't find a good foundation that works well with my skin. I'll exfoliate, moisturize, prime, and apply foundation, but it always looks kind of cakey and it outlines the dry flaky patches on my forehead and cheeks, which should have been taken care of with the exfoliation and moisturizer. This happens whether I use a beauty blender or a brush, with stick foundation or liquid foundation, with setting powder or without, with setting spray or without, and with primer or without. I'd love to be able to get that nice flawless-but-natural finish I see other people with, but every time I wear foundation it just looks terrible. It also doesn't last very long because the places where those dry patches are always go back to being oily and shiny within a couple hours, especially my nose.

I'm sure it doesn't help that I can't afford like, $40 foundation, but money is very tight. Currently using ELF hydrating primer and wet n wild photofocus stick foundation. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!"

I'm wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction for images that might spark a idea for me. 

I've been asked to design makeup for a bee character for an event - and I'm really lost as to where go with it.  The person asking me wanted ""high fashion"". However the costumes are very circus styled, with helmets that have the eyes in top.  

I'm feeling very lost as well where to start, as the ideas I'd thought of (blocked out eyebrows, with exaggerated large dark eye area) won't work as there are already eyes incorporated in the costume.  I don't think 4 eyed bees are a thing!  

Any thing that I could use to spark a bit of inspiration would be greatly appreciated!  

Thank you :)

I usually will then lightly apply a setting powder and then some bronzer. I don’t feel like I’m putting on a lot of product, but I also don’t look like other women who wear the same foundation (full coverage and a dewy glow).

Do you have any advice for designing makeup looks specifically for a photography/videography setting with intense artificial lighting?

So, anyway, there's a big difference. I'm having trouble finding tutorials that specifically address these issues.

Anyway 

Sooo, I was thinking about trying to do my makeup again for once.. Havent done it in maybe 2 yrs and Ive only ever tried eyeliner (poorly), but I know theres SO much more i could be doing. (Im an avid makeup video watcher despite not using it)

****So uhh. How do I work makeup on hooded eyes?****

(When I looked last, I watched two videos, both of which contradicted each other and said ""Dont do x thing because itll make your eyes look smaller!"" And then they each did the opposite of one another- (one used light colors on the eyelid, the other used dark.) Neither advice-ee had hooded eyelids. So im lookin to find advice from people who maybe actually know what to do here?)

I have light eyes, if the color matters for makeup looks- idk. Id definetly need concealer tho too bc my eyelids and undereyes are dark (from eyestrain &amp; undersleeping).

I teach middle school and every year for our Angel tree I’ve ended up being given the ones that ask for makeup (the school counselors know me well haha) &amp; they’ve said the same two I had last year will be applying again. 

I’m trying to compile a list of what I think a beginner/someone new to makeup would like and also keeping it middle school appropriate. 

My list so far is:

**Basic Skincare**
- gentle face wash
- night cream
- face masks 
- makeup wipes

**Makeup**
- Eyeshadow primer
- palette 
- basic brushes
- mascara primer
- mascara
- lip glosses
- blush
- setting spray 

I would love any budget recommendations (there isn’t technically a limit but they ask us to try to keep it under $100 for each child). This year I plan on including a $20 Ulta gift card as well so they can pick out something they know they’ll like.

I’m not too grossed out about the shadows that dropped onto the hallway floor, but one of the pretty blue shadows bounced into the bathroom closet and landed right beside my toilet plunger (shadow side up). I have no idea if it made contact with the plunger, but I’m so disgusted by the sheer proximity of it. Should I throw the shadows out (or the potentially plunger-contaminated shadow in particular)? A replacement palette would cost me three times what I originally paid (Tarte is currently selling the entire collection on their site, so the individual palette can not be purchased), but this is my current go-to palette."

Now after blending them I blinked and I kid you not, most of my crease shadow had vanished. I got super annoyed. I started playing with the glitter shade (usually just pat some eyeshadow with a not so dense brush for a subtle shimmer) and the toppers and it had no pay off. I tried super hard to pack it on the lid, with a flat brush and then with my finger and it was awful. Super patchy would not go onto my lids and after a lot of effort you can barely notice it. Have the eyeshadows gone bad? As I stated I had used them previously, just a couple of times but had no issue before. Is there any way to fix this or should I just throw them away?"

Currently I have the Tarte Amazonian clay airbrush foundation in light neutral, which is a little orangey on me. I also have Bourjis healthy mix in shade vanilla that I feel matches me very well.

1571096255,Makeup,I have become unable to wear makeup and feel pretty with it on.,"I’ve never worn makeup much from the get-go. I only wear it about 20 times a year and majority of those days it’s just me wanting to play with some looks. I rarely wear makeup to work or outside of the house. I used to feel confident, pretty, and more professional when wearing it but overtime I’ve become very anxious about it. 

Whenever I leave the house with it on I panic that it doesn’t look good enough. Every 5 seconds I’m checking to make sure my foundation matches my skin tone, checking if everything looks smooth with no texture (there is always texture), and just overall panic that I look like I’m trying too hard. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t wear makeup without feeling like absolute crap about myself. 

I feel safe wearing no makeup but I’m tired of it. I want to be able to feel pretty and confident about myself. I don’t know what makeup is supposed to look like on a person because I don’t have any girl friends. I have two grown adult women who rarely wear any makeup. Im 20 years old and don’t even know how to apply makeup so that I feel and look pretty and it’s embarrassing. 

Is there anything you think might help me with the situation?

so i spray the soap with some mario badescu rose water spray, leave it for a minute to soak, and then i rub a spoolie into the soap to bring up some product. i then brush through my brows to get a desired shape and fill in with a pencil (or sometimes pomade). when i initially run the soap through my brows, it really feels as though the hairs are going to be glued into place all day. they hold their shape well and i can do some really nice, fluffy brows with this technique (nothing i could have ever achieved with a regular gel). my only issue is that they don’t hold all day, barely an hour or two. 

if anyone knows why, it would be so helpful as i ADORE the soap brow look and it really does work for the first few moments, i just want it to last!!"

1571365414,Makeup,Em cosmetics honest reviews,"I’ve been looking to buy some make up products, but I’m considered a total newbie at this. Literally I can’t even wing an eyeliner, I don’t even wear mascara cause I’m a chicken and I think concealing pimples are harder than how makeup tutorials make it seem.  So I wanted to start off with more natural kind of make up and maybe see how things go.

Anyway I thought Em cosmetics by michelle phan looked really pretty and coincides with what kind of look I was going for. I was eyeing her new clear lip gloss and the soft amethyst blush but I don’t know if it’ll be too dark on my skin (I’ve seen the model pictures and stuff but I still can’t visualise it), if the formula is good for oily skin etc, does anyone have opinions or recommendations to share? It’s kind of pricey so I want to know if it’ll be worth every penny. 

TL;DR is em cosmetics soft amethyst blush &amp; their new clear lip gloss worth the price tag?"

* nyx born to glow liquid illuminator - sunbeam
* glossier haloscope - quartz
* essence pure nude - be my highlight
* ofra cosmetics collab w madison miller - sea shimmer
* physicians formula butter bronzer - champagne

1571554692,Makeup,New and Confused,"Okay, so I’m pretty new to makeup. I mean, I’ve done my makeup in the past, but it’s always been foundation, maybe some concealer, one shade of eyeshadow on my eyelids, mascara, and maybe a lipgloss. I got more into makeup when I started selling for a makeup company, but I realized after joining that it definitely was not for me, and the products weren’t nearly as good as advertised. Lesson learned. Do your research before jumping on the bandwagon.

Anyways, I only ever did my makeup for special events like Christmas, Halloween, or just going out for a birthday or something. I didn’t wear make up often. Once I got into college, I almost never did my makeup. I love sleep too much. But, I did get into skin care, which did an amazing job at clearing up my acne. Who knew? So, I did get to a point where I was really happy not to wear makeup because I felt like I wanted to kind of just be happy with my skin. I’ve always had self-esteem issues, so I didn’t want makeup to make me feel like I wasn’t pretty without it.

However, I feel like now I feel good enough about myself that I can start learning more about makeup. I love eyeshadow and lipstick especially. Does anyone have tips on just how to get started? I’ve been practicing at night before I wash my face so that I can kind of experiment without having to worry about looking bad the rest of the day. I’m just kind of hoping for some help, particularly with eyeshadow, eyeliner (seriously my eyes are so twitchy it’s impossible), false lashes (though I wear glasses so I’m not sure how well those would actually work for me), or just makeup things you enjoy and want to share with someone who’s willing to learn.

1568087471,Makeup,Any good colorful eyeshadow pallets?,[removed]
1568094117,Makeup,Beginner at Makeup. Send help. QUICK.,"Hello! Thanks for coming by to -maybe- help me out.

I survived with no makeup up until literally my high school graduation and by that I mean just wearing foundation on. JUST. foundation. 

Oh, I don’t even have a brush or a  blender to put the foundation. I used my hands 🖐 and my friend got mad at me for it when I told her. &lt;_&gt; (I’m sorry I was too broke to buy other materials) 

The foundation i have is all thanks to a friend who was willing to come with me and help me find the right match for my skin tone. It’s literally the only makeup I got up until I was given a James Charles palette this June because my other friend didn’t wanna follow/watch his videos anymore after that drama that involved him in it. Instead of throwing it away or setting it on fire, she gave it to me. 

I watch so much makeup videos for fun but I space out when they give tips and then skip to the final part when their makeup is already finished 😂  that’s why I’ve come here to ask about some makeup tips that I can reread anytime. 

So for the long waited question:
What comes after a foundation? What shade should I get my concealer if I’m olive skinned? What shade should I get my bronzer? What colors are preferable? What blushes look like you’re not too red or too flushed? What tips should I be aware of and how the heck will I work with a James Charles palette when this is my first time putting on makeup??? I’m a broke student so what are some good drug store makeup items?

I really don’t want to look like a literal clown. Send help."
1568095252,Makeup,How to 🛑 or slow down on buying makeup!,"Recently I’ve come to terms that makeup for me is an addiction! And while that might sound harsh it truly is something that consumes my everyday. I love trying new products and am slowly building my kit to start a freelance career. However, I recently stumbled upon an amazing YouTuber names Whitney Hendrick and boy was I smacked in the face with the steel beam of reality. She has a series called “how to stop buying makeup” and at first I was kinda hate watching and thinking “all my makeup has a purpose” until I actually started to listen and really hear what she was saying. She talks heavily on the beauty industry and how it truly is an a business and how we as consumers really get played when it come to some company’s. She also has really opened my eyes on how the influencers we see on Instagram and YouTube drive that addiction. Makeup is truly one of my favourite things in the whole world but I’m also passionate about brands who treat they’re consumers with respect. If we all stoped buying makeup one day the industry would collapse and it’s important to know you have that power! Brands who use way too much plastic to package their products or who test on animals or use animal hairs (mink lashes) are all around us! If anything hopefully this helps someone. This definitely doesn’t mean I’m never going to buy makeup ever again, now I’m just going to be more sensible when it comes to how I decide to spend my hard earned money and if a brand shares the same values that I have. 😘

1568123050,Makeup,"IN YOUR OPINION, WHAT IS THE MOST OVERRATED MAKEUP BRAND? THE MOST UNDERRATED?","\-I don't have an answer for overrated makeup because most drugstore brands that I try have at least a few products that I like.  I haven't tried enough high end makeup to know which brands are hyped up but have poor quality products.  There are some brands that I hear about ALL THE TIME. For example, I always hear people rave about Kylie Cosmetics and Fenty beauty. Are they really that good or do people just like them because of the celebrities who created them? 

\-As for underrated drugstore makeup, I definitely think that Rimmel London is one of those brands.  They have a lot of great products. I love their Stay Matte powder and concealer.  Someone here on Reddit mentioned it yesterday about Rimmel London being underrated and I completely agree.

\-Another brand that I think is underrated is L.A. Colors cosmetics.  Throughout the brand you will have some hits and misses but most products work pretty good.  They have some good eyeshadows, highlighters, and lip products.  I hear good things about their nail polish too but I haven't tried any yet.  It shows that you don't have to spend a lot of money to get good quality makeup.  If you go on Youtube look up MzGlamourAddict.  She does a lot of makeup tutorials using L.A. Colors cosmetics and she looks Fabulous."
1568128115,Makeup,What is a bargain product similar to Moccaran Oil Light?,"What is a bargain product similar to Moroccan Oil Light? I use that after every shower or before I blow dry or straighten my hair. I wash my hair about 3x a week and only blow dry or straighten for special occasions (probably about once a month if averaged out). I have long, thick, natural blonde hair. It isn’t super light. It can get oily, that’s why the light version was better for me. I only use it on the ends of my hair. It helps with breakage, split ends, and dryness. I’m worried about a different product making my hair too oily or leaving a residue or weird smell. In summer 2016 I bought the largest bottle of Moroccan oil light and it’s lasted me this long, I just wanted to know what people had tried for budget options that they were happy with. Thank you!"

This weekend I'm going to a festival in my city and it looks like it's going to be about 96 degrees with high humidity. Last year I got pretty sunburned, so I will most definitely be wearing a great deal of sunscreen. My question is in what order should I apply everything? Does sunscreen go on first? Should I reapply the sunscreen to my spf foundation or just apply more foundation?  Do you think I need to put on a primer along with everything?

Any tips would be greatly appreciated. I know my face is probably going to melt in the late afternoon heat, but I'm going to make an attempt to put on makeup anyway.

I usually epilate my chin and neck twice a week- however I am having my first laser hair removal appointment in another city on Thursday. They ask you not to remove the hair for at least a week prior to the appointment, and specifically told me not to shave it before my first appointment so they can pick the best laser based on my skin/hair type. Whilst I'm happy to stay at home until then so nobody can see me until then, I will need to get on a 4hr flight to get to my appointment (it's completely unaffordable in my city even with Groupons). So while I'm travelling, I need to mask the overgrown stubble- can anyone provide any products that might work for this?

I intend to go heavy on the eye makeup (smoke, lashes, the full shebang) to distract away from my jawline area, but need help to mask the beard I'm growing, and it's going to be a full on beard by then because I have a week left to leave it to grow and its already about 2mm in length (and bare in mind, super thick).  
My heaviest coverage foundation is Mac studio fix, I also own makeup forever hd, Nars sheer glow foundation. 

I'm trying to smooth out the skin as much as possible beforehand so using the ordinary's aha/bha peel every couple of days to even out my skin. I've taken a look at a few drag makeup artist examples of hiding hair but they're mostly to hide a 5 o'clock shadow and involve shaving first, not covering actual wiry course beard hair.

Wondering if anyone has advice on how to straighten or ally mascara to crushes eyelashes. 

I sleep with the left side of my face onthe pillow and as a result the eyelashes of my left eye are kind of squished.

When I apply mascara to my right eye the lashes get fanned out and lengthened. But on my left eye, the roots of the lashes curve so much that my mascara gathers there and can't really get at the tips. And trying to the the mascara on the whole of the lashes makes it clump. It's like the lashes are making an s-shape around the hood of my eye.

1568376011,Makeup,Resources for men?,"Hey everyone. I've recently started experimenting with makeup, sort of. To celebrate finally kicking my nail chewing habit, and to treat ourselves before our wedding, my wife and I got manicures. I really liked how the clear nail polish evened out my nails and I've started to also wear greenstick after seeing it on Queer Eye to help with redness on my face. 

I'm kind of interested in trying out more things but I'm not sure what to do. Most of the male make-up tutorials I see end with a fairly feminine look which is great but just not me. 

I think outside of what I do now is want to try something to reduce the bags under my eyes. I'm also interested in nail colours but I'm a little nervous about wearing it to work. 

Sorry this is kind of unfocused, just not sure where to go. Even  just a link to a more relevant subreddit would be great.

1568385667,Makeup,Silicone-Based or Water-Based,"Hello! A few days ago, I commented about silicone-based or water-based products that seemed to be helpful to a lot of people, so I figured that I’d create a dedicated post. Here’s basically everything you need to know about silicon-based or water-based products!

**Silicone or Water-Based: Why Should I Care?**

Silicone-based and water-based products won’t interact with each other. Think trying to mix oil and water-it just keeps separating no matter how much you try to mix the two. If you notice that your makeup is separating, it likely has to do with the fact that you’re mixing products that have different bases. The separation can happen immediately or after a while of wearing it. You’ll primarily see problems with primer and foundation, but your moisturizer and concealer can also affect things.

**Are Silicone-Based Products Bad for My Skin?**

Not necessarily. It’s not a bad ingredient, but if you have sensitive or acne-prone skin, silicone can exacerbate certain problems. If you’re using silicone-based products and you’re happy with your skin, I wouldn’t go and change your routine just to avoid it. 

But, if you are unhappy with your skin, trying to avoid silicone might be a way to try to clear it up.  

**I’m Using a Silicone-Based Product and a Water-Based Product and They Work.** **Is Something Wrong?**

No! There’s a sliding scale. Some products are silicone-based, but still have enough water and hydrating ingredients in the formula so that it will work well with a water-based product, and vice versa. If it’s working for you, don’t go and change it!

**How Can I Tell if Something is Silicone-Based or Water-Based?**

In general, most products are silicone-based. Anything pore-filling or smoothing will be silicone-based. You can really tell something is silicone-based by the texture. I’m not able to accurate describe the texture (someone else might be able to, please help me out here!). A good example of the texture of silicone-based products are the Elf Pore-Filling Primer or the Maybelline Baby Skin primer. Both have a very specific, silky, and are almost “too smooth”.

You’re going to need to look at the ingredient list. Since you’re just looking for the base of the product, you’re going to want to pay attention to the first half-dozen ingredients. Likely, the first ingredient will be water. That doesn’t necessarily mean that something is water-based. However, if there is a silicone in the first few ingredients, that product is silicone-based. Just to make things more complicated, a product might be water based even though there might be a silicone farther down the ingredient list. Unless it’s in the first half-dozen or so ingredients, it doesn’t really matter.

Silicone will rarely be listed as silicone in an ingredient list. Instead, look for Dimethicone, Amodimethicone, Methicone, Cyclomethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, or Dimethicone Copolyol. Basically, if it ends in -cone, it’s a silicone. Isododecane is also an ingredient found in silicone-based foundations. It’s not a silicone itself, but it is insoluble in water. If you’re not sure about an ingredient, just look it up!

The main reason you’ll want to pay attention to more than the first half-dozen ingredients is if there’s a SPF in a product. In those, generally the first few ingredients will have something to do with SPF, so you’ll need to look at maybe the first ten ingredients as opposed to the first six.

**Example-Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation-Silicone**

Aqua/Water, *Cyclopentasiloxane*, Glycerin, *Isododecane*, Alcohol Denat, Polyglyceryl-4 Isosterate, *Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone*

**Example-Elf Poreless Face Primer-Silicone**

*Dimethicone*, *Dimethicone Crosspolymer*, Tridecyl Trimellitate**,** *Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer*

**Example-BECCA Aqua Luminous Perfection Foundation-Water**

Water, Mineral Oil/Paraffinum Liquidum/Huile Minerale, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate

**Example- Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Primer-Water**

Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Water (Aqua, Eau), Glycerin, PEG-150 Distearate, Alcohol Denat., Polyglyceryl-10 Eicosanedioate/Tetradecanedioate

I’ve included a list of products in the comments noting whether they are water-based or silicone-based. I may have mislabeled something, so please check to make sure before you buy a product!"

It left an incredibly smooth finish on my skin (even without primer) and the pigment was great. It certainly did last the whole day, so it met that claim.

I was using the Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation before this, and the Urban Decay is even better.

Just wanted to share my experience. If you have scarring and open pores you need covered, this will do the job. If you are in Australia you can get it from Mecca Maxima for $65. It's pricey, but it's well worth it."

They have so much good stuff and everything is only one dollar.  If you are on a budget the Dollar Tree is the place to go.  Even if you are not on a budget the Dollar Tree is great.  My favorite aisle to stop by is the beauty aisle.  They have a lot of good beauty necessities like cotton rounds, q-tips, makeup wipes, and nail stuff.  And best of all, they have makeup.  The makeup brands they usually carry are L.A. Colors, Sassy and Chic, or Colormates.  But every once in a while you can hit the jackpot and find big name brands.

The best makeup I have found at the Dollar Tree would have to be the e.l.f. studio line lipsticks and the Milani eyeshadow sticks.  Anytime I find any of those brands is a good shopping trip.  Other brands I have found throughout the years have been Maybelline, Physicians Formula, Almay, Revlon, and Wet n Wild.  Recently I have found some skincare serums.  I haven't used them enough yet to form an opinion on how good they work.  My favorite skincare item would definitely have to be the Oxy Acne Medication Spot Treatment. That stuff actually works.  Finding it for one dollar was a great deal.  You never know what kind of treasures you will find at the Dollar Tree."

My boyfriend and I share one bathroom, 1 sink with almost no counter space. The counters are black granite which, while pretty, NOT practical. It shows everything. I want to keep our counters clean, typically I do my make up in the car. BUT when I do it at home my make up always ends up on the counters. I use Bare Minerals so sometimes it looks clean when I'm done but then a few minutes later it settles and it looks like our counters were just pulled up from being buried in the Sahara desert.

I use to put down a washcloth but I guess that didn't really work. It wasn't a lot at once but the makeup still built up. I've tried wiping it down but when I use a wet cloth it clumps and a dry cloth just pushes the dust on to our light-colored bathroom rug.

1568584415,Makeup,Help finding cost-friendly &amp; good quality makeup brands? (tl;dr provided),"Hii~ 

here’s some background:

I’m currently in makeup school rn and I wanna start investing in quality makeup for my career bc so far I’ve been depending on Walmart/drug store palates for practice (no hate, some drug store brands are really good) and they do the job but as I learn more advanced makeup and start doing professional work, I wanna  add things to my kit that have the pigment and quality you’d expect from a pro y’know?


my question:

so basically I was wondering if anyone could advise on makeup brands that are good quality (pigmented, not too talc-y in terms of eyeshadow, u know what I’m talking about)? I can’t exactly afford to spend $60 on a palate with ten colors but like $30-40 doesn’t sound awful. cruelty free is also preferred but I understand that beggars can’t be choosers ┑(￣Д ￣)┍

is there even like a master list to aid in selecting makeup to invest in?


TLDR

cost friendly, good quality, cruelty free makeup brands?

 I’m in school and starting my makeup career.
I haven’t been able to invest in expensive brands but is there any brand out there that won’t cause me to go broke that professionals work with?"
1568584896,Makeup,Budget basic makeup advice!,"Hi all,

I'm in dire need to replace most of my routine make up products and, sadly, I don't really have much of a budget (by the way, I'm in the UK). I'm not really proficient with makeup, so my usual routine would be concealer - foundation - eyeliner+mascara and occasional lipstick. I ran out of concealer and foundation, so I started searching for some valid replacements. Moreover, I wanted to ""spice things up"" and add some neutral eyeshadow and maybe a bit of bronzer in my routine, because I feel I look a bit dull with my current one :(

I'd say I have combination/prone to blemishes skin, it gets oily on the nose and forehead. I used the Maybelline stay matte so far, but I didn't really like it - made my T-zone oily very quickly, so I was wondering whether I should opt for oil free and non comedogenic foundations, such as Bareminerals? I know it's quite expensive, but if it is really good quality I'd be happy to purchase it.

That being said, do you have any suggestion for an alternative foundation and some good, but inexpensive concealers/eyeshadows/bronzer? Plus, I read everywhere I'd need a primer. I'm using Eucerin's Dermo Purifyer mattifying fluid under my foundation, but doesn't really help with the oiliness, only if I use it alone. Is what I'm doing okay, and if not, shall I get a primer?

Sorry if some questions may sound dumb, and thank you so much!"

My creases are extremely deep, and swallow up any eyeshadow that goes in there. Not only that, but it rubs off even with primer, so if most of my eyelids are visible you can see a makeup-less line where the deepest part of the crease is.

Eyeshadow also tends to transfer from the lower part of my lids to near my brow bone. Again, even if I use primer.

Due to the way my eyelids fold downward at the outer corners, winged eyeliner can be tricky (I've had some luck with the vamp stamp, that part is probably more a matter of practice. Then at the inner corners I have folds that don't really... cover things? So it makes putting any makeup there difficult, but if I don't then it's obvious, the fold won't hide it.

Plus, hooded eye makeup tutorials are not for this shape, so they look weird.

Any advice, anyone else had the same problem, I don't do great with a false lash and this stuff looks close to wearing a light pair, that is why I am sticking with it. Plus it was expensive and I am committed.

So the whole point, any advice, is there an easier way to take it off, it is just so thick"

I bought a vitamin C serum a few months ago and this morning when I pumped some out it had reddish orange streaks (it is normally white). Does this mean it’s too old to use? Is it going to be harmful if I use it?

1568805117,Makeup,Need suggestions on creating eyeshadow looks from Nomad Berlin Underground palette,"I know it’s a lot to ask, but I definitely need some suggestions on color combos to use on the [Nomad Berlin Underground palette](https://nomadcosmetics.com/products/berlin-palette) 

I am struggling to come up with ideas — call it writers block for makeup... There’s so many beautiful jewel tones but only one matte color :( 

I searched high and low for face charts and YouTube tutorials without any luck.  I’m pretty decent at mimicking or tweaking a guide already laid out for me.

There was one gal who had two different videos about this palette but i felt they were too intense and somewhat messy for my liking. I’m all for dramatic makeup but her application of the shadows weren’t quite my cup of tea. 

TLDR: Long-winded request for creative help on eyeshadow looks on the Nomad Berlin Underground palette :)"

I don’t even know where to start. I guess I need a foundation, eye liner and shadow, lip stick, and something for my brows? Small budget, so hoping to get everything at the drug store but open to splurging on one or two essential products at Sephora. 

Maybe important info:
- I don’t even know what color my complexion is 😂
- I like my freckles and I’m ok with them showing through foundation
- I prefer dewy rather matte 
- I’ll be wearing black
- my hair is somewhere between light brown and strawberry blonde. I’ll be wearing it down.
- I’m in my 40s and a mom so nothing too “junior”
- I used to wear makeup and my technique is good. I think I still have some brushes packed away somewhere

1568834819,Makeup,Possible to learn how to do natural wedding makeup in one month?,"I've been having a tough time getting in touch with the makeup artist that I hired for my wedding in late October. I'm trying to be patient and not think the worst (that she's ghosted me or something). I've been looking at other makeup artists as a backup plan in case I need to terminate my contract with her. Unfortunately, I'm a little over a month away from the wedding and it would likely be too short notice to find someone else. I was thinking another backup plan could be doing my own makeup but I'm worried it's too ambitious of an undertaking. I don't wear much makeup in my day to day (mainly just fill in my brows and light eyeliner) and don't know much about how to do advanced, waterproof, and long-lasting makeup (never use foundation, primer, blush, eye shadow, etc so it would really be starting from a beginner's level). Below is a link to the type of look that I'm going for. Would it be crazy for me to try to do this on my own given my limited understanding of makeup?

1568841313,Makeup,Foundation/primer issues,"I'm going to a relatives super formal wedding in a couple weeks and I rarely, if ever, wear foundation/primer, mostly because I'm lazy and my skin tends to break out.  

I went to Ulta a couple weeks ago and they recommended Clinique Even better Refresh, which I bought.  I've only worn it a couple times and while the color is right, I'm not sure if it's sinking into my pores or what but it looks spotty.  

I bought Urban Decay Complexion Primer that I'm wearing under it, I don't know if that's just not the right primer or if the foundation is wrong or what.

I have, until recently, had very oily skin.  About 4 months ago I started using the Ordinary products and the oily has decreased significantly.  I have lupus and a couple months ago I developed a crazy rash all over my face that was dry, flaky and red.  It's gone now, but it required to fairly strong steroid creams to get rid of it which has left patchy dry spots.  I'm moisturizing heavily at night to try to combat this and it's improving but isn't gone.

Any suggestions?"

If it’s perfect, perfect, perfect I’m willing to buy a cruelty free brand sold in China.  I get a bit greasy on my nose but other then that my skin is pretty normal but I am in my mid-40s so do I need like old lady makeup?  So far I’ve tried Smashbox Studio Skin,  Tarte Rainforest of the Sea and right now I’m using Urban Decay Stay Naked. The Urban Decay is ok- but very matte. I use it with their Optical Illusion Complexion Primer. I should say I am bad with makeup. I don’t have a lot of patience and never feel like I’m applying it correctly.

So my next question is how do you match your spot concealer? Is it different from your undereye concealer?

I ask because I am very pale with a pink undertone so I tend to use the lightest shades in concealer (currently favourite is makeup revolution conceal and define in C1) which works absolutely great on my undereyes, however if I use as a spot concealer it's way too bright and it's obvious I've done it.

So a little advice please :)

1568907006,Makeup,Better Than Sex mascara helped me get over my falsie addiction,"A little over a year and a half ago, I decided to try lash extensions. I’ve always hated the shape of my eyes, and they made me look so much more awake and open-eyed. This was dangerous though, because with my low self-image it quickly became addictive. I started to view my face with the lash extensions as my “normal” face, and as they fell out I felt worse and worse about myself. 

I had to stop the extensions as they were wearing on my natural lashes. But I couldn’t handle looking at myself without them. So, I started wearing falsies. Every. Single. Day. I met my current partner during this time, and I was so scared that he only loved my “lashed” face, so I continued wearing them. I slept in them, I’d wear them for days until the glue finally gave out. I engaged in super unhealthy behaviors (missing class because I couldn’t get them to stay on, and there was no way I was leaving my apartment without them on, stuff like that). I recently decided, after realizing how much money I’ve spent on falsies, and how unhealthy this has been, that this needed to stop. It has been a process, but this mascara has helped me immensely. It brings my lashes to the length and volume almost like the falsies, and makes me feel much better about my appearance without the hassle of falsies. My next step, of course, is to try to be more comfortable without the makeup on, but one step at a time."
